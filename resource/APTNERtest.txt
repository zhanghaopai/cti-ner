The O
Sednit S-APT
group O
– O
also O
known O
as O
APT28 S-APT
, O
Fancy B-APT
Bear E-APT
, O
Sofacy S-APT
or O
STRONTIUM S-APT
– O
has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2004 S-TIME
and O
has O
made O
headlines O
frequently O
in O
past O
years O
. O

Recently O
, O
we O
unveiled O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
UEFI S-TOOL
rootkit O
, O
called O
LoJax S-MAL
, O
which O
we O
attribute O
to O
the O
Sednit S-APT
group O
. O

This O
is O
a O
first O
for O
an O
APT O
group O
, O
and O
shows O
Sednit S-APT
has O
access O
to O
very O
sophisticated O
tools O
to O
conduct O
its O
espionage O
operations O
. O

Three O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
Sednit S-APT
group O
unleashed O
new O
components O
targeting O
victims O
in O
various O
countries O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC
and O
Central B-LOC
Asia E-LOC
. O

Since O
then O
, O
the O
number O
and O
diversity O
of O
components O
has O
increased O
drastically O
. O

ESET S-SECTEAM
researchers O
and O
colleagues O
from O
other O
companies O
have O
documented O
these O
components O
; O
however O
, O
in O
this O
article O
we O
will O
focus O
on O
what O
’s O
beyond O
the O
compromise O
, O
what O
the O
operators O
do O
once O
a O
victim O
system O
is O
running O
a O
Zebrocy S-MAL
Delphi S-TOOL
backdoor O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
August B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
, O
the O
Sednit S-APT
group O
launched O
a O
spearphishing S-ACT
email S-TOOL
campaign O
where O
it O
distributed O
shortened O
URLs O
that O
delivered O
the O
first O
stage O
of O
Zebrocy S-MAL
components O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
Sednit S-APT
used O
a O
similar O
technique O
for O
credential O
phishing E-ACT
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
unusual O
for O
the O
group O
to O
use O
this O
technique O
to O
deliver O
one O
of O
its O
malware O
components O
directly O
. O

Previously O
, O
it O
had O
used O
exploits O
to O
deliver O
and O
execute O
the O
first O
stage O
malware O
, O
while O
in O
this O
campaign O
the O
group O
relied O
entirely O
on O
social O
engineering O
to O
lure O
victims O
into O
running O
the O
first O
part O
of O
the O
chain O
. O

The O
screenshot O
in O
Figure O
1 O
shows O
Bitly S-TOOL
statistics O
for O
the O
shortened O
URL O
used O
in O
this O
campaign O
. O

While O
ESET S-SECTEAM
telemetry O
data O
indicates O
that O
this O
URL O
was O
delivered O
by O
spearphishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
, O
we O
don’t O
have O
a O
sample O
of O
such O
an O
email S-TOOL
. O

The O
shortened O
URL O
leads O
the O
victim O
to O
an O
IP-address-based O
URL O
, O
where O
the O
archived O
payload O
is O
located O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
without O
the O
email S-TOOL
message O
, O
we O
don’t O
know O
if O
there O
are O
any O
instructions O
for O
the O
user O
, O
if O
there O
is O
any O
further O
social O
engineering O
, O
or O
if O
it O
relies O
solely O
on O
the O
victim O
’s O
curiosity O
. O

The O
archive O
contains O
two O
files O
; O
the O
first O
is O
an O
executable O
file O
, O
while O
the O
second O
is O
a O
decoy O
PDF S-TOOL
document O
. O

Note O
there O
is O
a O
typo O
in O
the O
executable O
’s O
filename O
; O
Once O
the O
binary O
is O
executed O
, O
a O
password O
prompt O
dialog O
box O
opens O
. O

The O
result O
of O
the O
password O
validation O
will O
always O
be O
wrong O
, O
but O
after O
the O
apparent O
validation O
attempt O
, O
the O
decoy O
PDF S-TOOL
document O
is O
opened O
. O

That O
document O
appears O
to O
be O
empty O
, O
but O
the O
downloader O
, O
which O
is O
written O
in O
Delphi S-TOOL
, O
continues O
running O
in O
the O
background O
. O

The O
IP O
address O
is O
also O
used O
in O
the O
URL O
hardcoded O
into O
the O
first O
binary O
downloader O
. O

The O
Stage-1 O
downloader O
will O
download O
and O
execute O
a O
new O
downloader O
, O
written O
in O
C++ S-TOOL
, O
not O
so O
different O
from O
other O
Zebrocy S-MAL
downloaders O
. O

Once O
again O
this O
downloader O
is O
as O
straightforward O
as O
the O
Zebrocy S-MAL
gang O
’s O
other O
downloaders O
. O

It O
creates O
an O
ID O
and O
it O
downloads O
a O
new O
, O
interesting O
backdoor O
, O
( O
this O
time O
) O
written O
in O
Delphi S-TOOL
. O

As O
we O
explained O
in O
our O
most O
recent O
blogpost O
about O
Zebrocy S-MAL
, O
the O
configuration O
of O
the O
backdoor O
is O
stored O
in O
in O
the O
resource O
section O
and O
is O
split O
into O
four O
different O
hex-encoded S-ENCR
, O
encrypted O
blobs O
. O

These O
blobs O
contain O
the O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
configuration O
. O

Once O
the O
backdoor O
sends O
basic O
information O
about O
its O
newly O
compromised O
system O
, O
the O
operators O
take O
control O
of O
the O
backdoor O
and O
start O
to O
send O
commands O
right O
away O
. O

Hence O
, O
the O
time O
between O
the O
victim O
running O
the O
downloader O
and O
the O
operators O
’ O
first O
commands O
is O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

In O
this O
section O
we O
describe O
in O
more O
detail O
the O
commands O
performed O
manually O
by O
the O
operators O
through O
their O
Delphi S-TOOL
backdoor O
. O

The O
commands O
available O
are O
located O
in O
one O
of O
the O
configuration O
blobs O
mentioned O
earlier O
. O

The O
number O
of O
supported O
commands O
has O
increased O
over O
time O
, O
with O
the O
latest O
version O
of O
the O
backdoor O
having O
more O
than O
thirty O
. O

As O
we O
did O
not O
identify O
a O
pattern O
in O
the O
order O
which O
the O
commands O
are O
invoked O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
operators O
are O
executing O
them O
manually O
. O

The O
first O
set O
of O
commands O
gathers O
information O
about O
the O
victim O
’s O
computer O
and O
environment O
: O

Commands O
Arguments O
SCREENSHOT O
None O
SYS_INFO O
None O
GET_NETWORK O
None O
SCAN_ALL O
None O
. O

The O
commands O
above O
are O
commonly O
executed O
when O
the O
operators O
first O
connect O
to O
a O
newly O
activated O
backdoor O
. O

They O
don’t O
have O
any O
arguments O
, O
and O
they O
are O
quite O
self-explanatory O
. O

Other O
commands O
commonly O
seen O
executed O
shortly O
after O
these O
backdoors O
are O
activated O
. O

Those O
who O
already O
have O
read O
our O
previous O
articles O
about O
Zebrocy S-MAL
will O
notice O
that O
more O
or O
less O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
information O
is O
sent O
, O
over O
and O
over O
again O
by O
previous O
stages O
. O

This O
information O
is O
requested O
within O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
initial O
compromise O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
data O
the O
operator O
will O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
is O
quite O
considerable O
. O

In O
order O
to O
collect O
even O
more O
information O
, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
the O
Zebrocy S-MAL
operators O
upload O
and O
use O
dumpers O
on O
victims O
’ O
machines O
. O

The O
current O
dumpers O
have O
some O
similarities O
with O
those O
previously O
used O
by O
the O
group O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
Yandex B-TOOL
Browser E-TOOL
, O
Chromium S-TOOL
, O
7Star B-TOOL
Browser E-TOOL
( O
a O
Chromium-based B-TOOL
browser E-TOOL
) O
, O
and O
CentBrowser S-TOOL
are O
targeted O
, O
as O
well O
as O
versions O
of O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Outlook S-TOOL
from O
1997 S-TIME
through O
2016 S-TIME
. O

These O
dumpers O
create O
log O
files O
indicating O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
potential O
databases O
to O
dump O
: O

Command O
Arguments O
DOWNLOAD_LIST O
C:\ProgramData\Office\MS\out.txt S-FILE
, O
C:\ProgramData\Office\MS\text.txt S-FILE
. O

These O
dumpers O
are O
quickly O
removed O
once O
they O
have O
done O
their O
job O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
backdoor O
contains O
a O
list O
of O
filenames O
related O
to O
credentials O
from O
software O
listed O
below O
( O
database O
names O
) O
: O

database O
. O

The O
operators O
retrieve O
these O
files O
on O
the O
machine O
using O
the O
DOWNLOAD_LIST O
command O
. O

This O
command O
can O
be O
used O
when O
the O
operators O
are O
aware O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
interesting O
files O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

Finally O
, O
depending O
on O
how O
interesting O
the O
victim O
is O
, O
they O
malware O
operators O
may O
deploy O
another O
custom O
backdoor O
. O

This O
backdoor O
is O
executed O
using O
the O
CMD_EXECUTE O
command O
. O

There O
are O
some O
interesting O
facts O
here O

The O
Sofacy S-APT
group O
remains O
a O
persistent O
global O
threat O
. O

Unit B-SECTEAM
42 E-SECTEAM
and O
others O
have O
shown O
in O
the O
first B-TIME
half I-TIME
of I-TIME
2018 E-TIME
how O
this O
threat O
actor O
group O
continues O
to O
target O
multiple O
organizations O
throughout O
the O
world O
with O
a O
strong O
emphasis O
on O
government O
, O
diplomatic O
and O
other O
strategic O
organizations O
primarily O
in O
North B-LOC
America E-LOC
and O
Europe S-LOC
. O

Following O
up O
our O
most O
recent O
Sofacy S-APT
research O
in O
February S-TIME
and O
March B-TIME
of I-TIME
2018 E-TIME
, O
we O
have O
found O
a O
new O
campaign O
that O
uses O
a O
lesser O
known O
tool O
widely O
attributed O
to O
the O
Sofacy S-APT
group O
called O
Zebrocy S-MAL
. O

Zebrocy S-MAL
is O
delivered O
primarily O
via O
phishing S-ACT
attacks O
that O
contain O
malicious O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Office S-IDTY
documents O
with O
macros O
as O
well O
as O
simple O
executable O
file O
attachments O
. O

This O
third O
campaign O
is O
consistent O
with O
two O
previously O
reported O
attack O
campaigns O
in O
terms O
of O
targeting O
: O
the O
targets O
were O
government O
organizations O
dealing O
with O
foreign O
affairs O
. O

In O
this O
case O
however O
the O
targets O
were O
in O
different O
geopolitical O
regions O
. O

An O
interesting O
difference O
we O
found O
in O
this O
newest O
campaign O
was O
that O
the O
attacks O
using O
Zebrocy S-MAL
cast O
a O
far O
wider O
net O
within O
the O
target O
organization O
: O
the O
attackers O
sent O
phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
to O
a O
an O
exponentially O
larger O
number O
of O
individuals O
. O

The O
targeted O
individuals O
did O
not O
follow O
any O
significant O
pattern O
, O
and O
the O
email S-TOOL
addresses O
were O
found O
easily O
using O
web O
search O
engines O
. O

This O
is O
a O
stark O
contrast O
with O
other O
attacks O
commonly O
associated O
with O
the O
Sofacy S-APT
group O
where O
generally O
no O
more O
than O
a O
handful O
of O
victims O
are O
targeted O
within O
a O
single O
organization O
in O
a O
focus-fire O
style O
of O
attack O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
large O
number O
of O
Zebrocy S-MAL
attacks O
we O
discovered O
, O
we O
also O
observed O
instances O
of O
the O
Sofacy S-APT
group O
leveraging O
the O
Dynamic B-PROT
Data I-PROT
Exchange E-PROT
( O
DDE S-PROT
) O
exploit O
technique O
previously O
documented O
by O
McAfee S-SECTEAM
. O

The O
instances O
we O
observed O
, O
however O
, O
used O
the O
DDE O
exploit O
to O
deliver O
different O
payloads O
than O
what O
was O
observed O
previously O
. O

In O
one O
instance O
the O
DDE S-PROT
attack O
was O
used O
to O
deliver O
and O
install O
Zebrocy S-MAL
. O

In O
another O
instance O
, O
the O
DDE S-PROT
attack O
was O
used O
to O
deliver O
an O
open-source O
penetration O
testing O
toolkit O
called O
Koadic S-TOOL
. O

The O
Sofacy S-APT
group O
has O
leveraged O
open O
source O
or O
freely O
available O
tools O
and O
exploits O
in O
the O
past O
but O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
Unit B-SECTEAM
42 E-SECTEAM
has O
observed O
them O
leveraging O
the O
Koadic S-TOOL
toolkit O
. O

In O
our O
February S-TIME
report O
, O
we O
discovered O
the O
Sofacy S-APT
group O
using O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Office S-IDTY
documents O
with O
malicious O
macros O
to O
deliver O
the O
SofacyCarberp S-MAL
payload O
to O
multiple O
government O
entities O
. O

In O
that O
report O
, O
we O
documented O
our O
observation O
that O
the O
Sofacy S-APT
group O
appeared O
to O
use O
conventional O
obfuscation O
techniques O
to O
mask O
their O
infrastructure O
attribution O
by O
using O
random O
registrant O
and O
service O
provider O
information O
for O
each O
of O
their O
attacks O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
we O
noted O
that O
the O
Sofacy S-APT
group O
deployed O
a O
webpage O
on O
each O
of O
the O
domains O
. O

This O
is O
odd O
because O
attackers O
almost O
never O
set O
up O
an O
actual O
webpage O
on O
adversary O
C2 S-TOOL
infrastructure O
. O

Even O
stranger O
, O
each O
webpage O
contained O
the O
same O
content O
within O
the O
body O
. O

Since O
that O
report O
, O
we O
continued O
our O
research O
into O
this O
oddity O
. O

Using O
this O
artifact O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
pivot O
and O
discover O
another O
attack O
campaign O
using O
the O
DealersChoice S-TOOL
exploit O
kit O
with O
similar O
victimology O
to O
what O
we O
saw O
in O
February O
. O

Continuing O
to O
use O
this O
artifact O
, O
we O
discovered O
another O
domain O
with O
the O
same O
content O
body O
, O
supservermgr.com O
. O

This O
domain O
was O
registered O
on O
December B-TIME
20 I-TIME
, I-TIME
2017 E-TIME
and O
within O
a O
few O
days O
was O
resolving O
to O
92.222.136.105 S-IP
, O
which O
belonged O
to O
a O
well-known O

however O
, O
we O
were O

determine O
several O

which O
allowed O
us O
to O
expand O
our O

First O
, O
we O
determined O
the O

we O
collected O
, O

. O

Because O
the O
domain O
had O
been O
sinkholed O
, O
this O
activity O
could O
not O
be O
completed O
. O

Using O
AutoFocus S-TOOL
, O
we O
pivoted O
from O
the O

string O
to O
expand O
our O
data O
set O
to O
three O
additional O
Zebrocy S-MAL
samples O
using O
the O
exact O
same O
user O

. O

This O
led O
us O
to O
additional O
infrastructure O
for O
Zebrocy S-MAL
at O
185.25.51.198 S-IP
and O
185.25.50.93 S-IP
. O

At O
this O
point O
we O
had O
collected O
nearly O
thirty O

Additional O
pivoting O
based O
on O
artifacts O
unique O
to O
this O
malware O
family O
expanded O
our O
dataset O
to O
hundreds O
of O
samples O
used O
over O
the O
last O
several O
years O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
additional O

were O
the O
Delphi S-TOOL

as O
reported O
by O
ESET S-SECTEAM

However O
, O
several O
of O
the O
collected O
samples O
were O
a O
C++ S-TOOL
variant O
of O
the O
Zebrocy S-MAL
downloader O
tool O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
discovered O
evidence O
of O
a O
completely O
different O
payload O
in O
Koadic S-TOOL
being O
delivered O
as O

Also O
, O
we O
found O
the O

address O
185.25.50.93 S-IP
hosting O
C2 S-TOOL

for O

that O
we O
call O
DealersChoice S-TOOL
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
Sofacy S-APT
group O
is O
confident O
that O
the O
targeted O
individuals O
would O
be O
interested O
enough O
in O
the O
content O
to O
peruse O
through O
it O
. O

We O
analyzed O
the O
document O
to O
determine O
the O
reason O
that O
the O
malicious O
Flash S-TOOL
object O
only O
ran O
when O
the O
user O
scrolled O
to O
the O
third O
page O
. O

According O
to O
the O
document.xml S-FILE
file O
, O
the O
DealersChoice S-TOOL
loader O
SWF S-TOOL
exists O
after O
the O
“ O
covert-shores-small.png S-FILE
” O
image O
file O
within O
the O
delivery O
document O
. O

This O
image O
file O
exists O
on O
the O
third O
page O
of O
the O
document O
, O
so O
the O
user O
would O
have O
to O
scroll O
down O
in O
the O
document O
to O
this O
third O
page O
to O
get O
the O
SWF S-TOOL
file O
to O
run O
. O

The O
user O
may O
not O
notice O
the O
Flash S-TOOL
object O
on O
the O
page O
, O
as O
Word S-TOOL
displays O
it O
as O
a O
tiny O
black O
box O
in O
the O
document O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
Figure O
1 O
. O

This O
is O
an O
interesting O
anti-sandbox O
technique O
, O
as O
it O
requires O
human O
interaction O
prior O
to O
the O
document O
exhibiting O
any O
malicious O
activity O
. O

This O
DealersChoice S-TOOL
Flash S-TOOL
object O
shares O
a O
similar O
process O
to O
previous O
variants O
; O
however O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
Sofacy S-APT
actors O
have O
made O
slight O
changes O
to O
its O
internal O
code O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
actors O
used O
ActionScript S-TOOL
from O
an O
open O
source O
video O
player O
called O
“ O
f4player S-TOOL
” O
, O
which O
is O
freely O
available O
on O
GitHub S-TOOL
. O

The O
Sofacy S-APT
developer O
modified O
the O
f4player S-TOOL
’s O
ActionScript S-TOOL
to O
include O
additional O
code O
to O
load O
an O
embedded O
Flash S-TOOL
object O
. O

The O
additions O
include O
code O
to O
decrypt O
an O
embedded O
Flash S-TOOL
object O
and O
an O
event O
handler O
that O
calls O
a O
newly O
added O
function O
( O
“ O
skinEvent2 O
” O
) O
that O
plays O
the O
decrypted O
object O
. O

The O
above O
code O
allows O
DealersChoice S-TOOL
to O
load O
a O
second O
SWF S-TOOL
object O
, O
specifically O
loading O
it O
with O
an O
argument O
that O
includes O
a O
C2 S-TOOL
URL O
of O
“ O
http://ndpmedia24.com/0pq6m4f.m3u8 S-URL
” O
. O

The O
embedded O
SWF S-TOOL
extracts O
the O
domain O
from O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
URL O
passed O
to O
it O
and O
uses O
it O
to O
craft O
a O
URL O
to O
get O
the O
server O
’s O
‘ O
crossdomain.xml S-FILE
’ O
file O
in O
order O
to O
obtain O
permissions O
to O
load O
additional O
Flash S-TOOL
objects O
from O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
domain O
. O

The O
ActionScript S-TOOL
relies O
on O
event O
listeners O
to O
call O
specific O
functions O
when O
the O
event O
“ O
Event.COMPLETE S-FILE
” O
is O
triggered O
after O
successful O
HTTP S-PROT
requests O
are O
issued O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
. O

The O
event O
handlers O
call O
functions O
with O
the O
following O
names O
, O
which O
includes O
an O
incrementing O
number O
that O
represents O
the O
order O
in O
which O
the O
functions O
are O
called O
: O
onload1 O
, O
onload2 O
, O
onload3 O
, O
onload5 O
. O

With O
these O
event O
handlers O
created O
, O
the O
ActionScript S-TOOL
starts O
by O
gathering O
system O
data O
from O
the O
flash.system.Capabilities.serverString O
property O
( O
just O
like O
in O
the O
original O
DealersChoice.B S-FILE
samples O
) O
and O
issues O
an O
HTTP S-PROT
GET O
with O
the O
system O
data O
as O
a O
parameter O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
URL O
that O
was O
passed O
as O
an O
argument O
to O
the O
embedded O
SWF S-TOOL
when O
it O
was O
initially O
loaded O
. O

When O
this O
HTTP S-PROT
request O
completes O
, O
the O
event O
listener O
will O
call O
the O
‘ O
onload1 O
’ O
function O
. O

The O
‘ O
onload1 O
’ O
function O
parses O
the O
response O
data O
from O
the O
request O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
URL O
using O
regular O
expressions O
. O

The O
regular O
expressions O
suggest O
that O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
responds O
with O
content O
that O
is O
meant O
to O
resemble O
HTTP B-TOOL
Live I-TOOL
Steaming E-TOOL
( O
HLS S-TOOL
) O

, O
which O
is O
a O
protocol O
that O
uses O
HTTP S-PROT
to O
deliver O
audio O
and O
video O
files O
for O
streaming O
. O

The O
use O
of O
HLS S-TOOL
coincides O
with O
the O
use O
of O
ActionScript S-TOOL
code O
from O
the O
f4player S-TOOL
to O
make O
the O
traffic O
seem O
legitimate O
. O

The O
variables O
storing O
the O
results O
of O
the O
regular O
expression O
matches O
are O
used O
within O
the O
ActionScript S-TOOL
for O
further O
interaction O
with O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
. O

The O
‘ O
onload1 O
’ O
function O
then O
sends O
an O
HTTP S-PROT
GET O
request O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
domain O
using O
the O
value O
stored O
in O
the O
‘ O
r3 O
’ O
variable O
as O
a O
URL O
. O

When O
this O
HTTP S-PROT
request O
completes O
, O
the O
event O
listener O
will O
call O
the O
‘ O
onload2 O
’ O
function O
. O

The O
‘ O
onload2 O
’ O
function O
decrypts O
the O
response O
received O
from O
the O
HTTP S-PROT
request O
issued O
in O
‘ O
onload1 O
’ O
function O
. O

It O
does O
so O
by O
calling O
a O
sub-function O
to O
decrypt O
the O
content O
, O
using O
the O
value O
stored O
in O
the O
‘ O
r1 O
’ O
variable O
as O
a O
key O
. O

The O
sub-function O
to O
decrypt O
the O
content O
skips O
the O
first O
4 O
bytes O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
first O
four O
bytes O
of O
the O
downloaded O
content O
is O
in O
cleartext O
( O
most O
likely O
the O
“ O
FWS S-TOOL
” O
or O
“ O
CWS S-TOOL

header O
to O
look O
legitimate O
) O
. O

After O
decrypting O
the O
content O
, O
the O
‘ O
onload2 O
’ O
function O
will O
issue O
another O
HTTP S-PROT
GET O
request O
with O
the O
system O
data O
as O
a O
parameter O
, O
but O
this O
time O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
using O
a O

from O
the O
‘ O

When O
this O
request O
completes O
, O
the O
event O
listener O
will O
call O
the O
‘ O
onload3 O
’ O
function O
. O

The O
‘ O
onload3 O
’ O
function O
will O
take O
the O
response O
to O
the O
HTTP S-PROT
request O
in O
‘ O
onload2 O
’ O
and O
treat O
it O
as O
the O
payload O
. O

The O
ActionScript S-TOOL
will O
read O
each O
byte O
of O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
response O
and O
get O
the O
hexadecimal O
value O
. O

This O
hexadecimal O
string O
will O
most O
likely O
be O
a O
string O
of O
shellcode O
that O
will O
contain O
and O
decrypt O
the O
ultimate O
portable B-TOOL
executable E-TOOL
( O
PE S-TOOL
) O
payload O
. O

The O
string O
of O
comma O
separated O
hexadecimal O

is O
passed O
as O
a O
parameter O
when O
loading O
the O
SWF S-TOOL
file O
downloaded O
in O
‘ O
onload2 O
’ O
. O

This O
function O
creates O
an O
event O
listener O
for O
when O
the O
SWF S-TOOL
file O
is O
successfully O
loaded O
, O
which O
will O
call O
the O
‘ O
onload5 O
’ O
function O
. O

The O
‘ O
onload5 O
’ O
function O
is O
responsible O
for O
adding O
the O
newly O
loaded O
SWF S-TOOL
object O
as O
a O

. O

This O
loads O
the O
SWF S-TOOL

, O
effectively O
running O
the O
malicious O

on O
the O

. O

During O
our O
analysis O
, O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
coerce O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
into O
providing O
a O
malicious O
SWF S-TOOL

. O

As O
mentioned O
in O
our O
previous O

on O
DealersChoice S-TOOL
, O
the O
payload O
of O
choice O
for O
previous O
variants O
was O
SofacyCarberp S-MAL
( O
Seduploader S-MAL

, O
but O
we O
have O
no O
evidence O
to O
suggest O
this O

was O
used O
in O
this O

. O

We O
are O
actively O
researching O
and O
will O
update O
this O

in O
the O
event O
we O
discover O
the O
malicious O
Flash S-TOOL

The O

was O
last O
modified O
by O
a O

which O
provides O
a O

The O
previous O

This O

, O
as O
both O

continues O
to O
use O
their O
DealersChoice S-TOOL

in O
their O

campaigns O
. O

In O
the O
most O
recent O
variant O
, O
Sofacy S-APT
modified O
the O

by O
obtaining O

. O

Unlike O
previous O

Several O
sources O
estimate O
that O
by O
the O
year O
2020 S-TIME
some O
50 O
billion O
IoT S-TOOL
devices O
will O
be O
deployed O
worldwide O
. O

IoT S-TOOL
devices O
are O
purposefully O
designed O
to O
connect O
to O
a O
network O
and O
many O
are O
simply O
connected O
to O
the O
internet O
with O
little O
management O
or O
oversight O
. O

Such O
devices O
still O
must O
be O
identifiable O
, O
maintained O
, O
and O
monitored O
by O
security O
teams O
, O
especially O
in O
large O
complex O
enterprises O
. O

Some O
IoT S-TOOL

may O
even O
communicate O
basic O
telemetry O
back O
to O
the O
device O
manufacturer O
or O
have O
means O

In O

, O
the O
customers O

know O
they O
exist O
on O
the O

In O
2016 S-TIME
, O
the O
Mirai S-MAL
botnet O
was O
discovered O
by O
the O
malware O
research O
group O
MalwareMustDie S-SECTEAM
. O

The O
botnet O
initially O
consisted O
of O
IP O
cameras O
and O
basic O
home O
routers O
, O
two O
types O
of O
IoT S-TOOL
devices O
commonly O
found O
in O
the O
household O
. O

As O
more O
variants O
of O
Mirai S-MAL
emerged O
, O
so O
did O
the O
list O
IoT S-TOOL
devices O
it O
was O
targeting O
. O

The O
source O
code O
for O
the O
malware O
powering O
this O
botnet O
was O
eventually O
leaked O
online O
. O

In O
2018 S-TIME
, O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
home O
and O
small O
business O
networking O
and O
storage O
devices O
were O
compromised O
and O
loaded O
with O
the O
so-called O
“ O
VPN B-MAL
Filter E-MAL
” O
malware O
. O

The O
FBI S-IDTY
has O
publicly O
attributed O
this O
activity O
to O
a O
nation-state O
actor O
and O
took O
subsequent O
actions O
to O
disrupt O
this O
botnet O
, O
although O
the O
devices O
would O
remain O
vulnerable O
to O
re-infection O
unless O
proper O
firmware O
or O
security O
controls O
were O
put O
in O
place O
by O
the O
user O
. O

There O
were O
also O
multiple O
press O
reports O
of O
cyber-attacks O
on O
several O
devices O
during O
the O
opening O
ceremonies O
for O
the O
2018 S-TIME
Olympic B-IDTY
Games E-IDTY
in O
PyeongChang S-LOC
. O

Officials O
did O
confirm O
a O
few O
days O
later O
that O
they O
were O
a O
victim O
of O
malicious O
cyber-attacks O
that O
prevented O
attendees O
from O
printing O
their O
tickets O
to O
the O
Games S-IDTY
and O
televisions O
and O
internet O
access O
in O
the O
main O
press O
center O
simply O
stopped O
working O
. O

In O
April S-TIME
, O
security O
researchers O
in O
the O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Threat B-SECTEAM
Intelligence I-SECTEAM
Center E-SECTEAM
discovered O
infrastructure O
of O
a O
known O
adversary O
communicating O
to O
several O
external O
devices O
. O

Further O
research O
uncovered O
attempts O
by O
the O
actor O
to O
compromise O
popular O
IoT S-TOOL
devices O
( O
a O
VOIP B-TOOL
phone E-TOOL
, O
an O
office B-TOOL
printer E-TOOL
, O
and O
a O
video B-TOOL
decoder E-TOOL
) O
across O
multiple O
customer O
locations O
. O

The O
investigation O
uncovered O
that O
an O
actor O
had O
used O
these O
devices O
to O
gain O
initial O
access O
to O
corporate O
networks O
. O

In O
two O
of O
the O
cases O
, O
the O
passwords O
for O
the O
devices O
were O
deployed O
without O
changing O
the O
default O
manufacturer O
’s O
passwords O
and O
in O
the O
third O
instance O
the O
latest O
security O
update O
had O
not O
been O
applied O
to O
the O
device O
. O

These O
devices O
became O
points O
of O
ingress O
from O
which O
the O
actor O
established O
a O
presence O
on O
the O
network O
and O
continued O
looking O
for O
further O
access O
. O

Once O
the O
actor O
had O
successfully O
established O
access O
to O
the O
network O
, O
a O
simple O
network O
scan O
to O
look O
for O
other O
insecure O
devices O
allowed O
them O
to O
discover O
and O
move O
across O
the O
network O
in O
search O
of O
higher-privileged O
accounts O
that O
would O
grant O
access O
to O
higher-value O
data O
. O

After O
gaining O
access O
to O
each O
of O
the O
IoT S-TOOL
devices O
, O
the O
actor O
ran O
tcpdump O
to O
sniff O
network O
traffic O
on O
local O
subnets O
. O

They O
were O
also O
seen O
enumerating O
administrative O
groups O
to O
attempt O
further O
exploitation O
. O

As O
the O
actor O
moved O
from O
one O
device O
to O
another O
, O
they O
would O
drop O
a O
simple O
shell O
script O
to O
establish O
persistence O
on O
the O
network O
which O
allowed O
extended O
access O
to O
continue O
hunting O
. O

Analysis O
of O
network O
traffic O
showed O
the O
devices O
were O
also O
communicating O
with O
an O
external O
command B-TOOL
and I-TOOL
control E-TOOL
( O
C2 S-TOOL
) O
server O
. O

The O
following O
IP O
addresses O
are O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
used O
by O
the O
actor O
for O
command B-TOOL
and I-TOOL
control E-TOOL
( O
C2 S-TOOL
) O
during O
these O
intrusions O
: O

167.114.153.55 S-IP
94.237.37.28 S-IP
82.118.242.171 S-IP
31.220.61.251 S-IP
128.199.199.187 S-IP
. O

We O
attribute O
the O
attacks O
on O
these O
customers O
using O
three O
popular O
IoT S-TOOL
devices O
to O
an O
activity O
group O
that O
Microsoft S-IDTY
refers O
to O
as O
STRONTIUM S-APT
. O

Since O
we O
identified O
these O
attacks O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
, O
we O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
conclusively O
determine O
what O
STRONTIUM S-APT
’s O
ultimate O
objectives O
were O
in O
these O
intrusions O
. O

Over O
the O
last O
twelve O
months O
, O
Microsoft S-IDTY
has O
delivered O
nearly O
1400 O
nation-state O
notifications O
to O
those O
who O
have O
been O
targeted O
or O
compromised O
by O
STRONTIUM S-APT
. O

One O
in O
five O
notifications O
of O
STRONTIUM S-APT
activity O
were O
tied O
to O
attacks O

around O
the O
world O
. O

The O
remaining O
80% O
of O
STRONTIUM S-APT
attacks O
have O
largely O
targeted O
organizations O
in O
the O
following O
sectors O
: O
government O
, O
IT O
, O
military O
, O
defense O
, O
medicine O
, O
education O
, O
and O
engineering O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
and O
notified O
STRONTIUM S-APT
attacks O
against O
Olympic S-IDTY
organizing O
committees O
, O
anti-doping O
agencies O
, O
and O
the O
hospitality O

. O

The O
“ O

” O
malware O
has O
also O
been O
attributed O
to O
STRONTIUM S-APT
by O
the O
FBI S-IDTY
. O

Today O
we O
are O
sharing O
this O
information O
to O
raise O
awareness O
of O
these O
risks O
across O
the O
industry O
and O
calling O
for O
better O
enterprise O
integration O
of O
IoT S-TOOL
devices O
, O
particularly O
the O
ability O
to O
monitor O
IoT S-TOOL
device O
telemetry O
within O
enterprise O
networks O
. O

Today O
, O
the O
number O
of O
deployed O
IoT S-TOOL
devices O
outnumber O
the O
population O
of O
personal O
computers S-TOOL
and O
mobile B-TOOL
phones E-TOOL
, O
combined O
. O

With O
each O
networked O
IoT S-TOOL
device O
having O
its O
own O
separate O
network O
stack O
, O
it O
’s O
quite O
easy O
to O
see O
the O
need O
for O
better O
enterprise O
management O
, O
especially O
in O
today O
’s O
“ O
bring O
your O
own O
device O
” O
world O
. O

While O
much O
of O
the O
industry O
focuses O
on O
the O
threats O
of O
hardware O
implants O
, O
we O
can O
see O
in O
this O
example O
that O
adversaries O
are O
happy O
to O
exploit O
simpler O
configuration O
and O
security O
issues O
to O
achieve O
their O
objectives O
. O

These O
simple O
attacks O
taking O
advantage O
of O
weak O
device O
management O
are O
likely O
to O
expand O
as O
more O
IoT S-TOOL
devices O
are O
deployed O
in O
corporate O
environments O
. O

Upon O
conclusion O
of O
our O
investigation O
, O
we O
shared O
this O
information O
with O
the O
manufacturers O
of O
the O
specific O
devices O
involved O
and O
they O
have O
used O
this O
event O
to O
explore O
new O
protections O
in O
their O
products O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
broader O
focus O
across O
IoT S-TOOL
in O
general O
, O
both O
from O
security O
teams O
at O
organizations O
that O
need O
to O
be O
more O
aware O
of O
these O
types O
of O
threats O
, O
as O
well O
as O
from O
IoT S-TOOL
device O
makers O
who O
need O
to O
provide O
better O
enterprise O
support O
and O
monitoring O
capabilities O
to O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
security O
teams O
to O
defend O
their O

. O

The O
Flash S-TOOL
exploit O
is O
mostly O
unobfuscated O
with O
only O
some O
light O
variable O
name O
mangling O
. O

The O
attackers O
relied O
heavily O
on O
the O
CVE-2014-0515 S-VULID
Metasploit S-TOOL
module O
, O
which O
is O
well O
documented O

object O
that O
is O

The O
payload O
exploits O
a O
local O

vulnerability O
in O
the O
Windows S-OS
kernel O
if O
it O
detects O
that O
it O

It O
uses O
the O

to O
have O
the O

The O
primary O
difference O
between O
the O
CVE-2014-0515 S-VULID
metasploit O
module O
and O
this O
exploit O
is O
, O
obviously O
, O
the O
vulnerability O
. O

CVE-2014-0515 S-VULID
exploits O
a O
vulnerability O
in O
Flash S-TOOL
’s O
Shader O

, O
whereas O
CVE-2015-3043 S-VULID
exploits O
a O
vulnerability O
in O
Flash S-TOOL
’s O
FLV S-TOOL
processing O
. O

The O
culprit O
FLV S-TOOL
file O
is O
embedded O
within O
AS3 S-ENCR
in O
two O
chunks O
, O
and O
is O
reassembled O
at O
runtime O
. O

A O
buffer O
overflow O
vulnerability O
exists O
in O
Adobe B-TOOL
Flash I-TOOL
Player E-TOOL
( O
<=17.0.0.134 O
) O
when O
parsing O
malformed O
FLV S-TOOL
objects O
. O

Attackers O
exploiting O
the O
vulnerability O
can O
corrupt O
memory O
and O
gain O
remote O
code O
execution O
. O

In O
the O
exploit O
, O
the O
attacker O
embeds O
the O
FLV S-TOOL
object O
directly O
in O
the O
ActionScript S-TOOL
code O
, O
and O
plays O
the O
video O
using O
NetStream O
class O
. O

Files O
of O
the O
FLV S-TOOL
file O
format O
contain O
a O
sequence O
of O
Tag O
structures O
. O

Beginning O
within O
the O
data O
field O
, O
all O
contents O
of O
the O
FLV S-TOOL
stream O
become O
0xEE O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
data O
and O
lastsize O
fields O
are O
mangled O
. O

Since O
the O
size O
is O
controlled O
by O
the O
attacker O
, O
it O
’s O
possible O
to O
overflow O
the O
fixed O
size O
buffer O
with O
certain O
data O
. O

As O
the O
previous O
picture O
demonstrated O
, O
the O
followed O
Vector O
object O
’s O
length O
field O
being O
overflowed O
as O
0x80007fff O
, O
which O
enables O
the O
attacker O
to O
read/write O
arbitrary O
data O
within O
user O
space O
. O

Shellcode S-TOOL
is O
passed O
to O
the O
exploit O
from O
HTML S-TOOL
in O
flashvars O
. O

The O
shellcode S-TOOL
downloads O
the O
next O
stage O
payload O
, O
which O
is O
an O
executable O
passed O
in O
plaintext O
, O
to O
the O
temp O
directory O
with O
UrlDownloadToFileA O
, O
which O
it O
then O
runs O
with O
WinExec O
. O

This O
exploit O
delivers O
a O
malware O
variant O
that O
shares O
characteristics O
with O
the O
APT28 S-APT
backdoors O
CHOPSTICK S-MAL
and O
CORESHELL S-MAL
malware O
families O
, O
both O
described O
in O
our O
APT28 S-APT
whitepaper O
. O

The O
malware O
uses O
an O
RC4 S-ENCR
encryption O
key O
that O
was O
previously O
used O
by O
the O
CHOPSTICK B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
. O

And O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
messages O
include O
a O
checksum O
algorithm O
that O
resembles O
those O
used O
in O
CHOPSTICK B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
communications O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
network O
beacon O
traffic O
for O
the O
new O
malware O
resembles O
those O
used O
by O
the O
CORESHELL B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
. O

Like O
CORESHELL S-MAL
, O
one O
of O
the O
beacons O
includes O
a O
process O
listing O
from O
the O
victim O
host O
. O

And O
like O
CORESHELL S-MAL
, O
the O
new O
malware O
attempts O
to O
download O
a O
second-stage O
executable O
. O

One O
of O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
locations O
for O
the O
new O
payload O
, O
87.236.215.246 S-IP
, O
also O
hosts O
a O
suspected O
APT28 S-APT
domain O
ssl-icloud.com S-DOM
. O

The O
same O
subnet O
( O
87.236.215.0 S-DOM
/ O
24 O
) O
also O
hosts O
several O
known O
or O
suspected O
APT28 S-APT
domains O
. O

The O
payload O
contains O
an O
exploit O
for O
the O
unpatched O
local O
privilege O
escalation O
vulnerability O
CVE-2015-1701 S-VULID
in O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Windows S-OS
. O

The O
exploit O
uses O
CVE-2015-1701 S-VULID
to O
execute O
a O
callback O
in O
userspace O
. O

The O
callback O
gets O
the O
EPROCESS S-TOOL
structures O
of O
the O
current O
process O
and O
the O
System O
process O
, O
and O
copies O
data O
from O
the O
System O
token O
into O
the O
token O
of O
the O
current O
process O
. O

Upon O
completion O
, O
the O
payload O
continues O
execution O
in O
usermode O
with O
the O
privileges O
of O
the O
System O
process O
. O

Because O
CVE-2015-3043 S-VULID
is O
already O
patched O
, O
this O
remote O
exploit O
will O
not O
succeed O
on O
a O
fully O
patched O
system O
. O

If O
an O
attacker O
wanted O
to O
exploit O
CVE-2015-1701 S-VULID
, O
they O
would O
first O
have O
to O
be O
executing O
code O
on O
the O
victim O
’s O
machine O
. O

Barring O
authorized O
access O
to O
the O
victim O
’s O
machine O
, O
the O
attacker O
would O
have O
to O
find O
some O
other O
means O
, O
such O
as O
crafting O
a O
new O
Flash S-TOOL

, O
to O

Analysis O
of O
the O

The O
lure O
text O
in O
the O

claims O
the O
attachment O
is O
a O
calendar O

events O
relevant O
to O
the O

organizations O
and O
contained O
specific O
instructions O

the O
actions O
the O
victim O
would O
have O
to O
take O
if O
they O
had O
“ O
trouble O
viewing O
the O
document O
” O
. O

The O
attachment O
itself O
is O
an O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Excel S-TOOL
XLS S-TOOL
document O
that O
contains O
malicious O
macro S-TOOL
script O
. O

The O
document O
presents O
itself O
as O
a O
standard O
macro S-TOOL
document O
but O
has O
all O
of O
its O
text O
hidden O
until O
the O
victim O
enables O
macros S-TOOL
. O

Notably O
, O
all O
of O
the O
content O
text O
is O
accessible O
to O
the O
victim O
even O
before O
macros S-TOOL
are O
enabled O
. O

However O
, O
a O
white O
font O
color O
is O
applied O
to O
the O
text O
to O
make O
it O
appear O
that O
the O

The O
code O
above O
changes O
the O

and O
presents O
the O

. O

On O
initial O
inspection O
, O
the O
content O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
expected O
legitimate O
content O
, O
however O
, O
closer O
examination O
of O
the O
document O
shows O
several O
abnormal O
artifacts O
that O
would O
not O
exist O
in O
a O
legitimate O
document O
. O

Figure O

below O
shows O
how O
the O
delivery O
document O
initially O
looks O
and O
the O
transformation O
the O
content O
undergoes O
as O
the O
macro S-TOOL
runs O
. O

As O
mentioned O
in O
a O
recent O
ISC S-TOOL
diary O
entry O
, O
the O
macro S-TOOL
gets O
the O

2227 O
to O

similar O
to O
samples O
we O
have O
analyzed O
in O
the O

These O
differences O
include O
a O

It O
appears O
that O
Sofacy S-APT
may O
have O
used O
an O
open-source O
tool O
called O
Luckystrike S-TOOL
to O
generate O
the O
delivery O
document O
and/or O
the O
macro S-TOOL
used O
in O
this O
attack O
. O

Luckystrike S-TOOL
, O
which O
was O
presented O
at O
DerbyCon S-SECTEAM

in O
September B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
is O
a O
Microsoft S-IDTY
PowerShell S-TOOL
based O
tool O
that O
generates O
malicious O
delivery O
documents O
by O
allowing O
a O
user O
to O
add O
a O
macro S-TOOL
to O
an O
Excel S-TOOL
or O
Word S-TOOL
document O
to O
execute O
an O
embedded O
payload O
. O

We O
believe O
Sofacy S-APT
used O
this O
tool O
, O
as O
the O
macro S-TOOL
within O
their O
delivery O
document O
closely O
resembles O
the O
macros O
found O
within O
Luckystrike S-TOOL
. O

To O
confirm O
our O
suspicions O
, O
we O
generated O
a O
malicious O
Excel S-TOOL

with O
Luckystrike S-TOOL
and O
compared O
its O
macro S-TOOL
to O
the O
macro S-TOOL
found O
within O
Sofacy S-APT
’s O
delivery O
document O
. O

We O
found O
that O
there O
was O
only O
one O
difference O
between O
the O
macros O
besides O
the O
random O
function O
name O
and O
random O
cell O

that O
the O
Luckystrike S-TOOL
tool O
generates O
for O
each O
created O

. O

The O
one O
non-random O
string O
difference O
was O
the O
path O
to O
the O
“ O
.txt S-FILE
” O
and O
“ O
.exe S-FILE
” O
files O
within O
the O
command O
“ O
certutil O

” O
, O
as O
the O
Sofacy S-APT
document O
used O
“ O
C:\Programdata\ O
” O
for O
the O
path O
whereas O
the O
Luckystrike S-TOOL

used O
the O

stored O
in O
the O

The O

no O

They O
have O
been O
well O

and O
continue O

use O
similar O

This O
leads O
us O
to O
believe O
that O

Once O
inside O
the O

APT28 S-APT
sought O
out O
machines O
that O
controlled O
both O

, O
in O
a O

APT28 S-APT
gained O
initial O

computer O
to O
send O
the O

APT28 S-APT
used O
this O
technique O
to O
steal O

that O
allowed O

To O
spread O

APT28 S-APT
used O
a O
version O
of O
the O
EternalBlue S-VULNAME

This O
was O
combined O
with O
the O
heavy O
use O
of O
py2exe S-TOOL

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
we O
have O
seen O
APT28 S-APT
incorporate O
this O
exploit O
into O
their O

In O
the O
2016 S-TIME
incident O
, O
the O
victim O
was O
compromised O
after O
connecting O
to O
a O
hotel O
Wi-Fi B-TOOL

Twelve O
hours O
after O
the O
victim O
initially O
connected O

, O
APT28 S-APT
logged O
into O
the O

These O
12 O
hours O
could O
have O
been O
used O
to O
crack O
a O

After O
successfully O
accessing O
the O

, O
the O
attacker O
deployed O

on O
the O

, O
spread O
laterally O
through O
the O
victim's O

, O
and O
accessed O
the O

The O

originated O
from O
a O

was O
physically O
close O
to O
the O
victim O

We O
cannot O
confirm O
how O
the O
initial O

2016 S-TIME
incident O
; O
however O
, O
later O
in O

Since O
this O

allows O
an O
attacker O
to O
sniff O

In O
late O
October S-TIME

early O
November B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
, O
Unit B-SECTEAM
42 E-SECTEAM
intercepted O
a O
series O
of O
weaponized O
documents O
that O
use O
a O
technique O
to O
load O
remote O
templates O
containing O
a O
malicious B-TOOL
macro E-TOOL
. O

These O
types O
of O
weaponized O
documents O
are O
not O
uncommon O
but O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
identify O
as O
malicious O
by O
automated O
analysis O
systems O
due O
to O
their O
modular O
nature O
. O

Specific O
to O
this O
technique O
, O
if O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
is O
not O
available O
at O
the O
time O
of O
execution O
, O
the O
malicious O
code O
cannot O
be O
retrieved O
, O
rendering O
the O
delivery O
document O
largely O
benign O
. O

The O
weaponized O
documents O
targeted O
several O
government O
entities O
around O
the O
globe O
, O
including O
North B-LOC
America E-LOC
, O
Europe S-LOC
, O
and O
a O
former O
USSR B-LOC
state E-LOC
. O

Fortunately O
for O
us O
, O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
servers O
for O
several O
of O
these O
documents O
were O
still O
operational O
allowing O
for O
retrieval O
of O
the O
malicious B-TOOL
macro E-TOOL
and O
the O
subsequent O

. O

Analysis O
revealed O
a O
consistent O
first-stage O
payload O
of O
the O
well-documented O
Zebrocy S-MAL

Additional O
collection O
of O
related O
documents O
revealed O
a O
second O
first-stage O
payload O
that O
we O
have O
named O
‘ O
Cannon S-MAL
’ O
. O

Cannon S-MAL
has O
not O
been O
previously O
observed O
in O
use O
by O
the O
Sofacy S-APT
group O
and O
contains O
a O
novel O
email-based O
C2 S-TOOL
communication O
channel O
. O

email S-TOOL
as O
a O
C2 S-TOOL
channel O
is O
not O
a O
new O
tactic O
, O
but O
it O
is O
generally O
not O
observed O
in O
the O
wild O
as O
often O
as O
HTTP S-PROT
or O

. O

Using O
email S-TOOL
as O
a O
C2 S-TOOL

may O
also O
decrease O
the O
chance O
of O
detection O
, O
as O
sending O

may O
not O
necessarily O
construe O

The O
activity O
discussed O
in O
this O
blog O
revolves O
around O
two O
of O
the O
multitude O
of O
weaponized O

that O
we O
collected O
. O

These O
two O

A O
particularly O
interesting O
aspect O
of O
one O
of O
the O
two O
documents O
we O
analyzed O
was O
the O

used O
, O
crash B-FILE

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
instance O
of O
an O
adversary O
group O
using O
recent O
current O
events O
as O
a O
lure O
, O
but O
it O
is O
interesting O
to O
see O
this O
group O
attempt O
to O
capitalize O
on O
the O
attention O
of O
a O
catastrophic O
event O
to O
execute O
their O
attack O
. O

The O
initial O
sample O
we O
intercepted O
was O
a O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Word S-TOOL
document O
( O
SHA256 S-ENCR
: O

using O

. O

This O
document O
appeared O
to O
be O
targeting O
a O
government O
organization O
dealing O
with O
foreign O
affairs O
in O
Europe S-LOC
via O
spear-phishing S-ACT
. O

Once O
the O
user O
attempts O
to O
open O
the O
document O
, O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Word S-TOOL
immediately O
attempts O
to O
load O
the O
remote O
template O
containing O
a O
malicious B-TOOL
macro E-TOOL
and O
payload O
from O
the O
location O
specified O
within O
the O
settings.xml.rels S-FILE
file O
of O
the O
DOCX S-TOOL
document O
. O

If O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
has O
already O
been O
taken O
offline O
the O
document O
will O
still O
open O
, O
but O
Word S-TOOL
will O
be O
unable O
to O
retrieve O
the O
remote O
template O
and O
thus O
Word S-TOOL
will O
not O
load O
a O
macro S-TOOL
. O

In O
this O
situation O
, O
Word S-TOOL
will O
present O
the O
same O
lure O
document O
to O
the O
victim O
as O
seen O
in O
Figure O

, O
but O
without O
the O
ability O
to O
enable O
macros S-TOOL
via O
an O
Enable B-TOOL

button E-TOOL
. O

Assuming O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
is O
still O
operational O
however O
, O
Word S-TOOL
loads O
the O
remote O
template O
( O

) O
and O
the O
user O
is O
presented O
with O
the O
screen O
. O

Once O
the O
victim O
presses O
the O
Enable B-TOOL
content I-TOOL
button E-TOOL
, O
the O
embedded O
macro S-TOOL
is O
executed O
. O

The O
macros S-TOOL
used O
for O
these O
delivery O
documents O
use O
a O
less O
common O
method O
of O
using O
the O
AutoClose O
function O
. O

This O
is O
a O
form O
of O
anti-analysis O
as O
Word S-TOOL
will O
not O
fully O
execute O
the O
malicious O
code O
until O
the O
user O
closes O
the O
document O
. O

If O
an O
automated O
sandbox O
exits O
its O
analysis O
session O
without O
specifically O
closing O
out O
the O
document O
, O
the O
sandbox O
may O
miss O
the O
malicious O
activity O
entirely O
. O

Once O
successfully O
executed O
, O
the O
macro S-TOOL
will O
install O
a O
payload O
and O
save O
a O
document O
to O
the O
system O
. O

Typically O
, O
we O
expect O
to O
see O
a O
decoy O
document O
saved O
to O
the O
system O
and O
later O
displayed O
to O
make O
the O
victim O
less O
suspicious O
of O
malicious O
activity O
; O
however O
, O
in O
this O
case O
the O
document O
saved O
to O
the O
system O
was O
never O
displayed O
and O
does O
not O
contain O
any O
pertinent O
content O
to O
the O
Lion B-IDTY
Air E-IDTY
tragedy O
theme O
seen O
in O
the O
filename O
. O

The O
macro S-TOOL
obtains O
the O
document O
saved O
to O
the O
system O
from O
within O
the O
document O
stored O
as O
UserForm1.Label1.Caption S-FILE
and O
will O
write O
it O
to O
: O
%TEMP%\~temp.docm S-FILE

The O
macro S-TOOL
obtains O
the O
payload O
saved O
to O
the O
system O
from O
within O
the O
document O
stored O
as O
UserForm1.Label2.Caption S-FILE
and O
will O
write O
it O
to O
: O
%APPDATA%\MSDN\~msdn.exe S-FILE
. O

The O
macro S-TOOL
executes O
this O
payload O
in O
a O
rather O
interesting O
way O
by O
loading O
the O
dropped O
~temp.docm S-FILE
document O
and O
calling O
a O
function O
within O
its O
embedded O
macro O
to O
run O
the O
payload O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
creator O
of O
this O
delivery O
document O
chose O
to O
run O
the O
payload O
from O
the O
dropped O
file O
as O
an O
evasion O
technique O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
fact O
the O
initial O
macro S-TOOL
uses O
this O
dropped O
document O
for O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
payload O
may O
also O
explain O
why O
the O
document O
did O
not O
contain O
any O
decoy O
contents O
. O

To O
carry O
out O
this O
functionality O
, O
after O
writing O
the O

~temp.docm S-FILE
and O
~msdn.exe S-FILE
files O
to O
the O
system O
, O
the O
initial O
macro S-TOOL
will O
load O
the O
~temp.docm S-FILE
file O
as O
a O
Word S-TOOL
Document O
object O
and O
attempts O
to O
run O
the O
function O
Proc1 O
in O
the O
Module1 O
macro S-TOOL
within O
the O
~temp.docm S-FILE
file O
. O

The O
Proc1 O
function O
within O
the O
Module1 O
does O
nothing O
more O
than O
build O
the O
%APPDATA%\MSDN\~msdn.exe S-FILE
path O
to O
the O
dropped O
payload O
and O
executes O
it O
using O
the O
built-in O
Shell O
function O
. O

The O
payload O
dropped O
to O
the O
system O
( O
SHA256 S-ENCR

) O
is O
a O
UPX S-TOOL
packed O
Zebrocy S-MAL
variant O
written O
in O
the O
Delphi S-TOOL
language O
. O

This O
variant O
of O
Zebrocy S-MAL
is O
functionally O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
Delphi S-TOOL
based O
payloads O
discussed O
in O
our O
previous O
publication O
on O
Sofacy S-APT
attacks O
using O
Zebrocy S-MAL
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

The O
developer O
of O
this O
particular O
payload O
configured O
it O
to O
use O
the O
following O

to O
communicate O
with O
as O
its O
C2 S-TOOL
: O
http://188.241.58.170/local/s3/filters.php  S-FILE
. O

The O
Zebrocy S-MAL
Trojan S-MAL
gathers O
system O
specific O
information O
that O
it O
will O
send O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
via O
an O
HTTP O
POST O
request O
to O
the O
above O
URL O
. O

Like O
other O
Zebrocy S-MAL
samples O
, O
this O
Trojan S-MAL
collects O
system O
specific O
information O
it O
will O
send O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
by O
running O
the O
command O
SYSTEMINFO O
& O
TASKLIST O
on O
the O
command O
line O
and O
by O
enumerating O
information O
about O
connected O
storage O
devices O
. O

This O
specific O
variant O
of O
Zebrocy S-MAL
will O
also O
send O
a O
screenshot O
of O
the O
victim O
host O
as O
a O
JPEG S-TOOL
image O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
. O

The O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
will O
then O
provide O
a O
secondary O
payload O
to O
the O
beacon O
in O
ASCII S-TOOL
hexadecimal O
representation O
, O
which O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
will O
decode O
and O
write O
to O
the O
following O
location O
: O
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Audio\soundfix.exe S-FILE
. O

During O
our O
analysis O
, O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
provided O
a O
secondary O
payload O
that O
functionally O
appeared O
similar O
to O
the O
initial O
Zebrocy S-MAL
sample O
. O

The O
secondary O
payload O
was O
also O
written O
in O
Delphi S-TOOL
and O
its O
developer O
configured O
it O
to O
communicate O
with O
its O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
using O
HTTPS S-PROT
via O
the O
following O
URL O
: O
https://200.122.181.25/catalog/products/books.php S-URL
. O

We O
were O
able O
to O
collect O
a O
second O

well O
as O
the O
188.241.58.170 S-IP

its O
remote O
template O
. O

Structurally O
this O
sample O
was O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
initially O
analyzed O
document O
, O
but O
the O
payload O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
completely O
new O
tool O
which O
we O
have O
named O
Cannon S-MAL
. O

The O
tool O
is O
written O
in O
C# S-TOOL
whose O
malicious O
code O
exists O
in O
a O
namespace O
called O
cannon S-MAL
, O
which O
is O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
’s O
name O
. O

The O
Trojan S-MAL
functions O
primarily O
as O
a O
downloader O
that O
relies O
on O
emails S-TOOL
to O
communicate O
between O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
and O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
. O

To O
communicate O
with O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
, O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
will O
send O
emails S-TOOL
to O
specific O
email S-TOOL
addresses O
via O
SMTPS S-PROT
over O
TCP S-PROT
port O
587 O
. O

This O
tool O
also O
has O
a O
heavy O
reliance O
on O
EventHandlers O
with O
timers O
to O
run O
its O
methods O
in O
a O
specific O
order O
and O
potentially O
increase O
its O
evasion O
capability O
. O

The O
overall O
purpose O
of O
Cannon S-MAL
is O
to O
use O
several O
email S-TOOL
accounts O
to O
send O
system O
data O
( O
system O
information O
and O

) O
to O
the O
threat O
actors O
and O
to O
ultimately O
obtain O
a O
payload O
from O
an O
email S-TOOL
from O
the O
actors O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
following O
step-by-step O
process O
illustrates O
how O
Cannon S-MAL
communicates O
with O
the O
actor-controlled O

THE O
DUKES S-APT
7 O
YEARS O
OF O
RUSSIAN O
CYBERESPIONAGE O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
are O
a O
well-resourced O
, O
highly O
dedicated O
and O
organized O
cyberespionage O
group O
that O
we O
believe O
has O
been O
working O
for O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
since O
at O
least O
2008 S-TIME
to O
collect O
intelligence O
in O
support O
of O
foreign O
and O
security O
policy O
decision-making O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
primarily O
target O
Western O
governments O
and O
related O
organizations O
, O
such O
as O
government O
ministries O
and O
agencies O
, O
political O
think O
tanks O
, O
and O
governmental O
subcontractors O
. O

Their O
targets O
have O
also O
included O
the O
governments O
of O
members O
of O
the O
Commonwealth B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
Independent I-IDTY
States E-IDTY
; O
Asian O
, O
African O
, O
and O
Middle O
Eastern O
governments O
; O
organizations O
associated O
with O
Chechen O
extremism O
; O
and O
Russian O
speakers O
engaged O
in O
the O
illicit O
trade O
of O
controlled O
substances O
and O
drugs O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
are O
known O
to O
employ O
a O
vast O
arsenal O
of O
malware O
toolsets O
, O
which O
we O
identify O
as O
MiniDuke S-MAL
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
, O
OnionDuke S-MAL
, O
CozyDuke S-MAL
, O
CloudDuke S-MAL
, O
SeaDuke S-MAL
, O
HammerDuke S-MAL
, O
PinchDuke S-MAL
, O
and O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
. O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
have O
engaged O
in O
apparently O
biannual O
large-scale O
spear-phishing S-ACT
campaigns O
against O
hundreds O
or O
even O
thousands O
of O
recipients O
associated O
with O
governmental O
institutions O
and O
affiliated O
organizations O
. O

The O
earliest O
activity O
we O
have O
been O
able O
to O
definitively O
attribute O
to O
the O
Dukes S-APT
are O
two O
PinchDuke S-MAL
campaigns O
from O
November B-TIME
2008 E-TIME
. O

These O
campaigns O
use O
PinchDuke S-MAL
samples O
that O
were O
, O
according O
to O
their O
compilation O
timestamps O
, O
created O
on O
the O
5th B-TIME
and I-TIME
12th I-TIME
of I-TIME
November I-TIME
2008 E-TIME
. O

The O
campaign O
identifiers O
found O
in O
these O
two O
samples O
are O
respectively O
, O
“ O
alkavkaz.com20081105 S-ACT
” O
and O
“ O
cihaderi.net20081112 S-ACT
” O
. O

The O
first O
campaign O
identifier O
, O
found O
in O
the O
sample O
compiled O
on O
the O
5th S-TIME
, O
references O
alkavkaz.com S-DOM
, O
a O
domain O
associated O
with O
a O
Turkish O
website O
proclaiming O
to O
be O
the O
“ O
Chechan S-LOC
[sic] O
Informational O
Center O
” O
. O

The O
second O
campaign O
identifier O
, O
from O
the O
sample O
compiled O
on O
the O
12th S-TIME
, O
references O
cihaderi.net S-DOM
, O
another O
Turkish O
website O
that O
claims O
to O
provide O
“ O
news O
from O
the O
jihad O
world O
” O
and O
which O
dedicates O
a O
section O
of O
its O
site O
to O
Chechnya S-LOC
. O

Due O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
other O
PinchDuke S-MAL
samples O
from O
2008 S-TIME
or O
earlier O
, O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
estimate O
when O
the O
Duke S-APT
operation O
originally O
began O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
technical O
analysis O
of O
the O
known O
PinchDuke S-MAL
samples O
from O
2008 S-TIME
however O
, O
we O
believe O
PinchDuke S-MAL
to O
have O
been O
under O
development O
by O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2008 E-TIME
. O

In O
fact O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
by O
the O
autumn O
of O
2008 O
, O
the O
Dukes O
were O
already O
developing O
not O
one O
but O
at O
least O
two O
distinct O
malware O
toolsets O
. O

This O
assertion O
is O
based O
on O
the O
oldest O
currently O
known O
sample O
of O
another O
Duke S-APT
related O
toolset O
, O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
, O
which O
was O
compiled O
on O
the O
26th B-TIME
of I-TIME
January I-TIME
2009 E-TIME
. O

This O
sample O
, O
like O
the O
early O
PinchDuke S-MAL
samples O
, O
appears O
to O
already O
be O
a O
“ O
fully-grown O
” O
sample O
, O
which O
is O
why O
we O
believe O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
was O
under O
development O
by O
the O
autumn B-TIME
of I-TIME
2008 E-TIME
. O

That O
the O
Dukes S-APT
were O
already O
developing O
and O
operating O
at O
least O
two O
distinct O
malware O
toolsets O
by O
the O
second B-TIME
half I-TIME
of I-TIME
2008 E-TIME
suggests O
to O
us O
that O
either O
the O
size O
of O
their O
cyberespionage O
operation O
was O
already O
large O
enough O
to O
warrant O
such O
an O
arsenal O
of O
tools O
, O
or O
that O
they O
expected O
their O
operation O
to O
grow O
significantly O
enough O
in O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
to O
warrant O
the O
development O
of O
such O
an O
arsenal O
. O

The O
origins O
of O
the O
Duke S-APT
toolset O
names O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
when O
researchers O
at O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Labs E-SECTEAM
coined O
the O
term O
“ O
MiniDuke S-MAL
” O
to O
identify O
the O
first O
Duke S-APT
related O
malware O
they O
found O
. O

As O
explained O
in O
their O
whitepaper O
, O
the O
researchers O
observed O
the O
surprisingly O
small O
MiniDuke B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
being O
spread O
via O
the O
same O
exploit O
that O
was O
being O
used O
by O
a O
malware O
that O
they O
had O
already O
named O
ItaDuke S-MAL
; O
the O
“ O
Duke S-APT
” O
part O
of O
this O
malware O
’s O
name O
had O
in O
turn O
come O
about O
because O
it O
reminded O
the O
researchers O
of O
the O
notable O
Duqu S-MAL
threat O
. O

Despite O
the O
shared O
history O
of O
the O
name O
itself O
however O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
Duke S-APT
toolsets O
themselves O
are O
in O
any O
way O
related O
to O
the O
ItaDuke S-MAL
malware O
, O
or O
to O
Duqu S-MAL
for O
that O
matter O
. O

As O
researchers O
continued O
discovering O
new O
toolsets O
that O
were O
created O
and O
used O
by O
the O
same O
group O
that O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke S-MAL
, O
the O
new O
toolsets O
were O
also O
given O
“ O
Duke S-APT
” O
-derived O
names O
, O
and O
thus O
the O
threat O
actor O
operating O
the O
toolsets O
started O
to O
be O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
“ O
the O
Dukes S-APT
” O
. O

The O
only O
other O
publicly O
used O
name O
for O
the O
threat O
actor O
that O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
is O
“ O
APT29 S-APT
” O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
campaign O
identifiers O
found O
in O
PinchDuke S-MAL
samples O
discovered O
from O
2009 S-TIME
, O
the O
targets O
of O
the O
Dukes S-APT
group O
during O
that O
year O
included O
organizations O
such O
as O
the O
Ministry B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
Defense E-IDTY
of O
Georgia S-LOC
and O
the O
ministries O
of O
foreign O
affairs O
of O
Turkey S-LOC
and O
Uganda S-LOC
. O

Campaign O
identifiers O
from O
2009 S-TIME
also O
reveal O
that O
by O
that O
time O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
were O
already O
actively O
interested O
in O
political O
matters O
related O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States E-LOC
( O
US S-LOC
) O
and O
the O
North B-IDTY
Atlantic I-IDTY
Treaty I-IDTY
Organization E-IDTY
( O
NATO S-IDTY
) O
, O
as O
they O
ran O
campaigns O
targeting O
( O
among O
other O
organizations O
) O
a O
US S-LOC
based O
foreign O
policy O

, O
another O
set O
of O
campaigns O
related O
to O
a O
NATO S-IDTY
exercise O
held O
in O
Europe S-LOC
, O
and O
a O
third O
set O
apparently O
targeting O
what O
was O
then O
known O
as O
the O
Georgian S-LOC
“ O
Information O
Centre O
on O
NATO S-IDTY
” O
. O

Of O
these O
campaigns O
, O
two O
clusters O
in O
particular O
stand O
out O
. O

The O
first O
is O
a O
set O
of O
campaigns O
from O
the O
16th B-TIME
and I-TIME
17th I-TIME
of I-TIME
April I-TIME
, I-TIME
2009 E-TIME
, O
that O
targeted O
a O
US S-LOC

foreign O
policy O
think O
tank O
, O
as O
well O
as O
government O
institutions O
in O
Poland S-LOC
and O
the O
Czech B-LOC
Republic E-LOC
. O

These O
campaigns O
utilized O
specially-crafted O
malicious O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Word S-TOOL
documents O
and O
PDF S-TOOL

, O
which O
were O
sent O
as O
e-mail S-TOOL

to O
various O
personnel O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
infiltrate O
the O

. O

We O
believe O
this O
cluster O
of O
campaigns O
had O
a O
joint O
goal O
of O
gathering O
intelligence O
on O
the O
sentiments O
of O
the O
targeted O
5 O
countries O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
plans O
being O
discussed O
at O
the O
time O
for O
the O
US S-LOC
to O
locate O
their O
“ O
European O
Interceptor O
Site O
” O
missile O
defense O
base O
in O
Poland S-LOC
, O
with O
a O
related O
radar O
station O
that O
was O
intended O
to O
be O
located O
in O
the O
Czech B-LOC
Republic E-LOC
. O

Regarding O
the O
timing O
of O
these O
campaigns O
, O
it O
is O
curious O
to O
note O
that O
they O
began O
only O
11 O
days O
after O
President O
Barack O
Obama O
gave O
a O
speech O
on O
the O
5th B-TIME
of I-TIME
April E-TIME
declaring O
his O
intention O
to O
proceed O
with O
the O
deployment O
of O
these O
missile O
defenses O
. O

The O
second O
notable O
cluster O
comprises O
of O
two O
campaigns O
that O
were O
possibly O
aimed O
at O
gathering O
information O
on O
Georgia S-LOC-NATO S-IDTY
relations O
. O

The O
first O
of O
these O
runs O
used O
the O
campaign O
identifier O
“ O
natoinfo_ge S-ACT
” O
, O
an O
apparent O
reference O
to O
the O
www.natoinfo.ge S-DOM
website O
belonging O
to O
a O
Georgian O
political O
body O
that O
has O
since O
been O
renamed O
“ O
Information O
Centre O
on O
NATO S-IDTY
and O
EU S-LOC
” O
. O

Although O
the O
campaign O
identifier O
itself O
doesn’t O
contain O
a O
date O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
campaign O
to O
have O
originated O
around O
the O
7th B-TIME
of I-TIME
June I-TIME
2009 E-TIME
, O
which O
was O
when O
the O
PinchDuke S-MAL
sample O
in O
question O
was O
compiled O
. O

This O
belief O
is O
based O
on O
the O
observation O
that O
in O
all O
of O
the O
other O
PinchDuke S-MAL
samples O
we O
have O
analyzed O
, O
the O
date O
of O
the O
campaign O
identifier O
has O
been O
within O
a O
day O
of O
the O
compilation O
date O
. O

The O
second O
campaign O
identifier O
, O
which O
we O
suspect O
may O
be O
related O
, O
is O
“ O
mod_ge_2009_07_03 S-ACT
” O
from O
a O
month O
later O
and O
apparently O
targeting O
the O
Ministry B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
Defense E-IDTY
of O
Georgia S-LOC
. O

The O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2010 E-TIME
saw O
continued O
PinchDuke S-MAL
campaigns O
against O
Turkey S-LOC
and O
Georgia S-LOC
, O
but O
also O
numerous O
campaigns O
against O
other O
members O
of O
the O
Commonwealth B-LOC
of I-LOC
Independent I-LOC
States E-LOC
such O
as O
Kazakhstan S-LOC
, O
Kyrgyzstan S-LOC
, O
Azerbaijan S-LOC
and O
Uzbekistan S-LOC
. O

Of O
these O
, O
the O
campaign O
with O
the O
identifier O
“ O
kaz_2010_07_30 S-ACT
” O
, O
which O
possibly O
targeted O
Kazakhstan S-LOC
, O
is O
of O
note O
because O
it O
is O
the O
last O
PinchDuke S-MAL
campaign O
we O
have O
observed O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
during O
the O
first B-TIME
half I-TIME
of I-TIME
2010 E-TIME
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
slowly O
migrated O
from O
PinchDuke S-MAL
and O
started O
using O
a O
new O
infostealer O
malware O
toolset O
that O
we O
call O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
. O

The O
first O
known O
sample O
of O
the O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
toolset O
was O
compiled O
on O
the O
16th B-TIME
of I-TIME
January I-TIME
2010 E-TIME
. O

Back O
then O
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
still O
lacked O
most O
of O
the O
credential-stealing O
functionality O
found O
in O
later O
samples O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
during O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2010 E-TIME
, O
the O
credential O
and O
file O
stealing O
capabilities O
of O
PinchDuke S-MAL
were O
slowly O
ported O
to O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
, O
effectively O
making O
PinchDuke S-MAL
obsolete O
. O

During O
this O
period O
of O
transition O
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
would O
often O
embed O
PinchDuke S-MAL
so O
that O
, O
upon O
execution O
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
would O
write O
to O
disk O
and O
execute O
PinchDuke S-MAL
. O

Both O
PinchDuke S-MAL
and O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
would O
then O
operate O
independently O
on O
the O
same O
compromised O
host O
, O
including O
performing O
separate O
information O
gathering O
, O
data O
Exfiltration S-ACT
and O
communication O
with O
a O
command B-TOOL
and I-TOOL
control E-TOOL
( O
C&C S-TOOL
) O
server O
- O
although O
both O
malware O
would O
often O
use O
the O
same O
C&C S-TOOL
server O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
parallel O
use O
was O
to O
‘ O
fieldtest O
’ O
the O
new O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
tool O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
ensuring O
operational O
success O
with O
the O
tried-and-tested O
PinchDuke S-MAL
. O

During O
this O
period O
of O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
testing O
and O
development O
, O
the O
Duke S-APT
authors O
also O
started O
experimenting O
with O
the O
use O
of O
privilege O
escalation O
vulnerabilities O
. O

Specifically O
, O
on O
the O
19th B-TIME
of I-TIME
January I-TIME
2010 E-TIME
security O
researcher O
Tavis O
Ormandy O
disclosed O
a O
local O
privilege O
escalation O
vulnerability O
( O
CVE-2010-0232 S-VULID
) O
affecting O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Windows S-OS
. O

As O
part O
of O
the O
disclosure O
, O
Ormandy O
also O
included O
the O
source O
code O
for O
a O
proof-of- O
concept O
exploit O
for O
the O
vulnerability O
. O

Just O
7 O
days O
later O
, O
on O
the O
26th B-TIME
of I-TIME
January E-TIME
, O
a O
component O
for O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
was O
compiled O
that O
exploited O
the O
vulnerability O
and O
allowed O
the O
tool O
to O
operate O
with O
higher O
privileges O
. O

During O
2011 S-TIME
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
appear O
to O
have O
significantly O
expanded O
both O
their O
arsenal O
of O
malware O
toolsets O
and O
their O
C&C S-TOOL
infrastructure O
. O

While O
the O
Dukes S-APT
employed O
both O
hacked O
websites O
and O
purposely O
rented O
servers O
for O
their O
C&C S-TOOL
infrastructure O
, O
the O
group O
rarely O
registered O
their O
own O
domain O
names O
, O
preferring O
instead O
to O
connect O
to O
their O
self- O
operated O
servers O
via O
IP O
addresses O
. O

The O
beginning B-TIME
of I-TIME
2011 E-TIME
however O
saw O
a O
significant O
break O
from O
that O
routine O
, O
when O
a O
large O
grouping O
of O
domain O
names O
was O
registered O
by O
the O
Dukes S-APT
in O
two O
batches O
; O
the O
first O
batch O
was O
registered O
on O
the O
29th B-TIME
of I-TIME
January E-TIME
and O
the O
second O
on O
the O
13th B-TIME
of I-TIME
February E-TIME
. O

All O
the O
domains O
in O
both O
batches O
were O
initially O
registered O
with O
the O
same O
alias O
: O
“ O
John O
Kasai O
of O
Klagenfurt S-LOC
, O
Austria S-LOC
” O
. O

These O
domains O
were O
used O
by O
the O
Dukes S-APT
in O
campaigns O
involving O
many O
of O
their O
different O
malware O
toolsets O
all O
the O
way O
until O
2014 S-TIME
. O

Like O
the O
“ O
MiniDuke S-MAL
loader O
” O
, O
these O
“ O
John O
Kasai O
” O
domains O
also O
provide O
a O
common O
thread O
tying O
together O
much O
of O
the O
tools O
and O
infrastructure O
of O
the O
Dukes S-APT
. O

By O
2011 S-TIME
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
had O
already O
developed O
at O
least O
3 O
distinct O
malware O
toolsets O
, O
including O
a O
plethora O
of O
supporting O
components O
such O
as O
loaders O
and O
persistence O
modules O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
as O
a O
sign O
of O
their O
arsenal O
’s O
breadth O
, O
they O
had O
already O
decided O
to O
retire O
one O
of O
these O
malware O
toolsets O
as O
obsolete O
after O
developing O
a O
replacement O
for O
it O
, O
seemingly O
from O
scratch O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
continued O
the O
expansion O
of O
their O
arsenal O
in O
2011 S-TIME
with O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
more O
toolsets O
: O
MiniDuke S-MAL
and O
CozyDuke S-MAL
. O

While O
all O
of O
the O
earlier O
toolsets O
– O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
, O
PinchDuke S-MAL
, O
and O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
– O
were O
designed O
around O
a O
core O
infostealer O
component O
, O
MiniDuke S-MAL
is O
centered O
on O
a O
simplistic O
backdoor O
component O
whose O
purpose O
is O
to O
enable O
the O
remote O
execution O
of O
commands O
on O
the O
compromised O
system O
. O

The O
first O
observed O
samples O
of O
the O
MiniDuke B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
component O
are O
from O
May B-TIME
2011 E-TIME
. O

This O
backdoor O
component O
however O
is O
technically O
very O
closely O
related O
to O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
, O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
we O
believe O
them O
to O
share O
parts O
of O
their O
source O
code O
. O

The O
origins O
of O
MiniDuke S-MAL
can O
thus O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
the O
origins O
of O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
, O
of O
which O
the O
earliest O
observed O
sample O
was O
compiled O
in O
January B-TIME
of I-TIME
2009 E-TIME
. O

Unlike O
the O
simplistic O
MiniDuke S-MAL
toolset O
, O
CozyDuke S-MAL
is O
a O
highly O
versatile O
, O
modular O
, O
malware O
“ O
platform O
” O
whose O
functionality O
lies O
not O
in O
a O
single O
core O
component O
but O
in O
an O
array O
of O
modules O
that O
it O
may O
be O
instructed O
to O
download O
from O
its O
C&C S-TOOL
server O
. O

These O
modules O
are O
used O
to O
selectively O
provide O
CozyDuke S-MAL
with O
just O
the O
functionality O
deemed O
necessary O
for O
the O
mission O
at O
hand O
. O

CozyDuke S-MAL
’s O
modular O
platform O
approach O
is O
a O
clear O
break O
from O
the O
designs O
of O
the O
previous O
Duke S-APT
toolsets O
. O

The O
stylistic O
differences O
between O
CozyDuke S-MAL
and O
its O
older O
siblings O
are O
further O
exemplified O
by O
the O
way O
it O
was O
coded O
. O

All O
of O
the O
4 O
previously O
mentioned O
toolsets O
were O
written O
in O
a O
minimalistic O
style O
commonly O
seen O
with O
malware O
; O
MiniDuke S-MAL
even O
goes O
as O
far O
as O
having O
many O
components O
written O
in O
Assembly O
language O
. O

CozyDuke S-MAL
however O
represents O
the O
complete O
opposite O
. O

Instead O
of O
being O
written O
in O
Assembly O
or O
C S-TOOL
, O
it O
was O
written O
in O
C++ S-TOOL
, O
which O
provides O
added O
layers O
of O
abstraction O
for O
the O
developer O
’s O
perusal O
, O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
added O
complexity O
. O

Contrary O
to O
what O
might O
be O
expected O
from O
malware O
, O
early O
CozyDuke S-MAL
versions O
also O
lacked O
any O
attempt O
at O
obfuscating O
or O
hiding O
their O
true O
nature O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
they O
were O
extremely O
open O
and O
verbose O
about O
their O
functionality O
- O
for O
example O
, O
early O
samples O
contained O
a O
plethora O
of O
logging O
messages O
in O
unencrypted O
form O
. O

In O
comparison O
, O
even O
the O
earliest O
known O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
samples O
encrypted O
any O
strings O
that O
might O
have O
given O
away O
the O
malware O
’s O
true O
nature O
. O

Finally O
, O
early O
CozyDuke S-MAL
versions O
also O
featured O
other O
elements O
that O
one O
would O
associate O
more O
with O
a O
traditional O
software O
development O
project O
than O
with O
malware O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the O
earliest O
known O
CozyDuke S-MAL
version O
utilized O
a O
feature O
of O
the O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Visual S-TOOL
C++ S-TOOL
compiler O
known O
as O
run-time O
error O
checking O
. O

This O
feature O
added O
automatic O
error O
checking O
to O
critical O
parts O
of O
the O
program O
’s O
execution O
at O
the O
cost O
, O
from O
a O
malware O
perspective O
, O
of O
providing O
additional O
hints O
that O
make O
the O
malware O
’s O
functionality O
easier O
for O
reverse O
engineers O
to O
understand O
. O

Based O
on O
these O
and O
other O
similar O
stylistic O
differences O
observed O
between O
CozyDuke S-MAL
and O
its O
older O
siblings O
, O
we O
speculate O
that O
while O
the O
older O
Duke S-APT
families O
appear O
to O
be O
the O
work O
of O
someone O
with O
a O
background O
in O
malware O
writing O
( O
or O
at O
the O
least O
in O
hacking O
) O
, O
CozyDuke S-MAL
’s O
author O
or O
authors O
more O
likely O
came O
from O
a O
software O
development O
background O
. O

We O
still O
know O
surprisingly O
few O
specifics O
about O
the O
Dukes S-APT
group O
’s O
activities O
during O
2012 S-TIME
. O

Based O
on O
samples O
of O
Duke S-APT
malware O
from O
2012 S-TIME
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
do O
appear O
to O
have O
continued O
actively O
using O
and O
developing O
all O
of O
their O
tools O
. O

Of O
these O
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
and O
MiniDuke S-MAL
appear O
to O
have O
been O
in O
more O
active O
use O
, O
while O
receiving O
only O
minor O
updates O
. O

GeminiDuke S-MAL
and O
CozyDuke S-MAL
on O
the O
other O
hand O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
less O
used O
in O
actual O
operations O
, O
but O
did O
undergo O
much O
more O
significant O
development O
. O

On O
the O
12th B-TIME
of I-TIME
February I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
published O

that O
were O

8 O
days O

an O

On O
27th B-TIME

, O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
and O
CrySyS B-SECTEAM
Lab E-SECTEAM
published O
research O
on O
this O
previously O
unidentified O
malware O
family O
, O
dubbing O
it O
MiniDuke S-MAL
. O

As O
we O
now O
know O
, O
by O
February B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
the O
Dukes S-APT
group O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke S-MAL
and O
other O
toolsets O
for O
at O
least O
4 B-TIME
and I-TIME
a I-TIME
half I-TIME
years E-TIME
. O

Their O
malware O
had O
not O
stayed O
undetected O
for O
those O
4 B-TIME
and I-TIME
a I-TIME
half I-TIME
years E-TIME
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
2009 S-TIME
a O
PinchDuke S-MAL
sample O
had O
been O
included O
in O
the O
malware O
set O
used O
by O
the O
AV-Test S-SECTEAM
security O
product O
testing O
organization O
to O
perform O
anti-virus O
product O
comparison O
reviews O
. O

Until O
2013 S-TIME
however O
, O
earlier O
Duke S-APT
toolsets O
had O
not O
been O
put O
in O
a O
proper O
context O
. O

That O
finally O
started O
to O
change O
in O
2013 S-TIME
. O

The O
MiniDuke S-MAL
samples O
that O
were O
spread O
using O
these O
exploits O
were O
compiled O
on O
the O
20th B-TIME
of I-TIME
February E-TIME
, O
after O
the O
exploit O
was O
already O
publicly O
known O
. O

One O
might O
argue O
that O
since O
this O
took O
place O
after O
the O
exploits O
were O
publicly O
mentioned O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
simply O
copied O
them O
. O

We O
however O
do O
not O
believe O
so O
. O

As O
mentioned O
by O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
, O
even O
though O
the O
exploits O
used O
for O
these O
MiniDuke S-MAL
campaigns O
were O
near-identical O
to O
those O
described O
by O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
, O
there O
were O
nevertheless O
small O
differences O
. O

Of O
these O
, O
the O
crucial O
one O
is O
the O
presence O
of O
PDB S-TOOL
strings O
in O
the O
MiniDuke S-MAL
exploits O
. O

These O
strings O
, O
which O
are O
generated O
by O
the O
compiler O
when O
using O
specific O
compilation O
settings O
, O
means O
that O
the O
components O
of O
the O
exploits O
used O
with O
MiniDuke S-MAL
had O
to O
have O
been O
compiled O
independently O
from O
those O
described O
by O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
. O

We O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
the O
Dukes S-APT
compiled O
the O
components O
themselves O
or O
whether O
someone O
else O
compiled O
the O
components O
before O
handing O
them O
to O
the O
group O
. O

This O
does O
however O
still O
rule O
out O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
Dukes S-APT
simply O
obtained O
copies O
of O
the O
exploit O
binaries O
described O
by O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
and O
repurposed O
them O
. O

In O
our O
opinion O
, O
this O
insistence O
on O
using O
exploits O
that O
are O
already O
under O
heightened O
scrutiny O
suggests O
the O
existence O
of O
at O
least O
one O
of O
three O
circumstances O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
may O
have O
been O
confident O
enough O
in O
their O
own O
abilities O
( O
and O
in O
the O
slowness O
of O
their O
opponents O
to O
react O
to O
new O
threats O
) O
that O
they O
did O
not O
care O
if O
their O
targets O
may O
already O
be O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
anyone O
exploiting O
these O
vulnerabilities O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
value O
the O
Dukes S-APT
intended O
to O
gain O
from O
these O
MiniDuke S-MAL
campaigns O
may O
have O
been O
so O
great O
that O
they O
deemed O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
of O
getting O
noticed O
. O

Or O
thirdly O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
may O
have O
invested O
so O
much O
into O
these O
campaigns O
that O
by O
the O
time O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
published O
their O
alert O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
felt O
they O
could O
not O
afford O
to O
halt O
the O
campaigns O
. O

We O
believe O
all O
three O
circumstances O
to O
have O
coexisted O
at O
least O
to O
some O
extent O
. O

As O
will O
become O
evident O
in O
this O
report O
, O
this O
was O
not O
a O
one-off O
case O
but O
a O
recurring O
theme O
with O
the O
Dukes S-APT
, O
in O
that O
they O
would O
rather O
continue O
with O
their O
operations O
as O
planned O
than O
retreat O
from O
operating O
under O
the O
spotlight O
. O

As O
originally O
detailed O
in O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
’s O
whitepaper O
, O
the O
MiniDuke S-MAL
campaigns O
from O
February B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
employed O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
with O
malicious O
PDF S-TOOL
file O
attachments O
. O

These O
PDFs S-TOOL
would O
attempt O
to O
silently O
infect O
the O
recipient O
with O
MiniDuke S-MAL
, O
while O
distracting O
them O
by O
displaying O
a O
decoy O
document O
. O

The O
headings O
of O
these O
documents O
included O
“ O
Ukraine S-LOC
’s O
NATO S-IDTY
Membership O
Action O
Plan O
( O
MAP O
) O

” O
, O
“ O

Rights O
” O
, O
and O
“ O
Ukraine S-LOC
’s O
Search O
for O
a O
Regional O
Foreign O
Policy O
” O
. O

The O
targets O
of O
these O
campaigns O
, O
according O
to O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
, O
were O
located O
variously O
in O
Belgium S-LOC
, O
Hungary S-LOC
, O
Luxembourg S-LOC
and O
Spain S-LOC
. O

Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
goes O
on O
to O
state O
that O
by O
obtaining O
log O
files O
from O
the O
MiniDuke S-MAL
command B-TOOL
and I-TOOL
control E-TOOL
servers O
, O
they O
were O
able O
to O
identify O
high-profile O
victims O
from O
Ukraine S-LOC
, O
Belgium S-LOC
, O
Portugal S-LOC
, O
Romania S-LOC
, O
the O
Czech B-LOC
Republic E-LOC
, O
Ireland S-LOC
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States E-LOC
and O
Hungary S-LOC
. O

After O
the O
February S-TIME
campaigns O
, O
MiniDuke S-MAL
activity O
appeared O
to O
quiet O
down O
, O
although O
it O
did O
not O
fully O
stop O
, O
for O
the O
rest B-TIME
of I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
group O
as O
a O
whole O
however O
showed O
no O
sign O
of O
slowing O
down O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
we O
saw O
yet O
another O
Duke S-APT
malware O
toolset O
, O
OnionDuke S-MAL
, O
appear O
first O
in O
2013 S-TIME
. O

Like O
CozyDuke S-MAL
, O
OnionDuke S-MAL
appears O
to O
have O
been O
designed O
with O
versatility O
in O
mind O
, O
and O
takes O
a O
similarly O
modular O
platform O
approach O
. O

The O
OnionDuke S-MAL
toolset O
includes O
various O
modules O
for O
purposes O
such O
as O
password O
stealing O
, O
information O
gathering O
, O
denial B-TOOL
of I-TOOL
service E-TOOL
( O
DoS S-TOOL
) O
attacks O
, O
and O
even O
posting O
spam O
to O
the O
Russian O
social O
media O
network O
, O
VKontakte S-TOOL
. O

The O
OnionDuke S-MAL
toolset O
also O
includes O
a O
dropper O
, O
an O
information O
stealer O
variant O
and O
multiple O
distinct O
versions O
of O
the O
core O
component O
that O
is O
responsible O
for O
interacting O
with O
the O
various O
modules O
. O

What O
makes O
OnionDuke S-MAL
especially O
curious O
is O
an O
infection O
vector O
it O
began O
using O
during O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
. O

To O
spread O
the O
toolset O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
used O
a O
wrapper O
to O
combine O
OnionDuke S-MAL
with O
legitimate O
applications O
, O
created O
torrent O
files O
containing O
these O
trojanized O
applications O
, O
then O
uploaded O
them O
to O
websites O
hosting O
torrent O
files O
. O

Victims O
who O
used O
the O
torrent O
files O
to O
download O
the O
applications O
would O
end O
up O
getting O
infected O
with O
OnionDuke S-MAL
. O

For O
most O
of O
the O
OnionDuke S-MAL
components O
we O
observed O
, O
the O
first O
versions O
that O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
were O
compiled O
during O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
was O
a O
period O
of O
active O
development O
around O
this O
toolset O
. O

Critically O
however O
, O
the O
first O
sample O
of O
the O
OnionDuke S-MAL
dropper O
, O
which O
we O
have O
observed O
being O
used O
only O
with O
components O
of O
this O
toolset O
, O
was O
compiled O
on O
the O
17th B-TIME
of I-TIME
February I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
. O

This O
is O
significant O
because O
it O
suggests O
that O
OnionDuke S-MAL
was O
under O
development O
before O
any O
part O
of O
the O
Duke S-APT
operation O
became O
public O
. O

OnionDuke S-MAL
’s O
development O
therefore O
could O
not O
have O
been O
simply O
a O
response O
to O
the O
outing O
of O
one O
of O
the O
other O
Duke S-APT
malware O
, O
but O
was O
instead O
intended O
for O
use O
alongside O
the O
other O
toolsets O
. O

This O
indication O
that O
the O
Dukes S-APT
planned O
to O
use O
an O
arsenal O
of O
5 O
malware O
toolsets O
in O
parallel O
suggests O
that O
they O
were O
operating O
with O
both O
significant O
resources O
and O
capacity O
. O

In O
2013 S-TIME
, O
many O
of O
the O
decoy O
documents O
employed O
by O
the O
Dukes S-APT
in O
their O
campaigns O
were O
related O
to O
Ukraine S-LOC
; O
examples O
include O
a O
letter O
undersigned O
by O
the O
First O
Deputy O
Minister O
for O
Foreign B-IDTY
Affairs E-IDTY
of O
Ukraine S-LOC
, O
a O
letter O
from O
the O
embassy O
of O
the O
Netherlands S-LOC
in O
Ukraine S-LOC
to O
the O
Ukrainian B-IDTY
Ministry E-IDTY
of O
Foreign B-IDTY
affairs E-IDTY
and O
a O
document O
titled O
“ O
Ukraine S-LOC
’s O
Search O
for O
a O
Regional O
Foreign O
Policy O
” O
. O

These O
decoy O
documents O
however O
were O
written O
before O
the O
start B-TIME
of I-TIME
the I-TIME
November I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
Euromaidan S-ACT
protests O
in O
Ukraine S-APT
and O
the O
subsequent O
upheaval O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
important O
to O
note O
that O
, O
contrary O
to O
what O
might O
be O
assumed O
, O
we O
have O
actually O
observed O
a O
drop O
instead O
of O
an O
increase O
in O
Ukraine S-LOC
related O
campaigns O
from O
the O
Dukes S-APT
following O
the O
country O
’s O
political O
crisis O
. O

This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
some O
other O
suspected O
Russian O
threat O
actors O
( O
such O
as O
Operation B-ACT
Pawn I-ACT
Storm E-ACT
) O
who O
appear O
to O
have O
increased O
their O
targeting O
of O
Ukraine O
following O
the O
crisis O
. O

This O
supports O
our O
analysis O
that O
the O
overarching O
theme O
in O
the O
Dukes S-APT
’ O
targeting O
is O
the O
collection O
of O
intelligence O
to O
support O
diplomatic O
efforts O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine S-LOC
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Russia S-LOC
was O
still O
weighing O
her O
options O
, O
but O
once O
Russia S-LOC
moved O
from O
diplomacy O
to O
direct O
action O
, O
Ukraine S-LOC
was O
no O
longer O
relevant O
to O
the O
Dukes S-APT
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

In O
a O
surprising O
turn O
of O
events O
, O
in O
September B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
a O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
campaign O
was O
observed O
targeting O
Russian O
speakers O
involved O
in O
the O
trade O
of O
illegal O
and O
controlled O
substances O
. O

Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Labs E-SECTEAM
, O
who O
sometimes O
refer O
to O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
as O
‘ O
Bot O
Gen O
Studio O
’ O
, O
speculated O
that O
“ O
one O
possibility O
is O
that O
‘ O
Bot O
Gen O
Studio O
’ O
is O
a O
malware O
platform O
also O
available O
as O
a O
so-called O
‘ O
legal O
spyware O
’ O
tool O
” O
; O

therefore O
, O
those O
using O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
to O
target O
drug O
dealers O
and O
those O
targeting O
governments O
are O
two O
separate O
entities O
. O

We O
however O
feel O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
the O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
operators O
targeting O
drug O
dealers O
and O
those O
targeting O
governments O
could O
be O
two O
entirely O
independent O
entities O
. O

A O
shared O
supplier O
of O
malware O
would O
explain O
the O
overlap O
in O
tools O
, O
but O
it O
would O
not O
explain O
the O
significant O
overlap O
we O
have O
also O
observed O
in O
operational O
techniques O
related O
to O
command O
and O
control O
infrastructure O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
feel O
the O
targeting O
of O
drug O
dealers O
was O
a O
new O
task O
for O
a O
subset O
of O
the O
Dukes S-APT
group O
, O
possibly O
due O
to O
the O
drug O
trade O
’s O
relevance O
to O
security O
policy O
issues O
. O

We O
also O
believe O
the O
tasking O
to O
have O
been O
temporary O
, O
because O
we O
have O
not O
observed O
any O
further O
similar O
targeting O
from O
the O
Dukes S-APT
after O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
. O

While O
MiniDuke S-MAL
activity O
decreased O
significantly O
during O
the O
rest B-TIME
of I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
following O
the O
attention O
it O
garnered O
from O
researchers O
, O
the O
beginning B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
saw O
the O
toolset O
back O
in O
full O
force O
. O

All O
MiniDuke S-MAL
components O
, O
from O
the O
loader O
and O
downloader O
to O
the O
backdoor O
, O
had O
been O
slightly O
updated O
and O
modified O
during O
the O
downtime O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
nature O
of O
these O
modifications O
suggests O
that O
their O
primary O
purpose O
was O
to O
regain O
the O
element O
of O
stealth O
and O
undetectability O
that O
had O
been O
lost O
almost O
a O
year O
earlier O
. O

Of O
these O
modifications O
, O
arguably O
the O
most O
important O
were O
the O
ones O
done O
to O
the O
loader O
. O

These O
resulted O
in O
a O
loader O
version O
that O
would O
later O
become O
known O
as O
the O
“ O
Nemesis B-MAL
Gemina I-MAL
loader E-MAL
” O
due O
to O
PDB S-TOOL
strings O
found O
in O
many O
of O
the O
samples O
. O

It O
is O
however O
still O
only O
an O
iteration O
on O
earlier O
versions O
of O
the O
MiniDuke S-MAL
loader O
. O

The O
first O
observed O
samples O
of O
the O
Nemesis B-MAL
Gemina I-MAL
loader E-MAL
( O
compiled O
on O
14th B-TIME
December I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
) O
were O
used O
to O
load O
the O
updated O
MiniDuke B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
, O
but O
by O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
the O
Nemesis B-MAL
Gemina I-MAL
loader E-MAL
was O
also O
observed O
in O
use O
with O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
. O

Following O
the O
MiniDuke S-MAL
expose O
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
in O
turn O
got O
its O
moment O
of O
fame O
when O
F-Secure S-SECTEAM
published O
a O
whitepaper O
about O
it O
on O
2nd B-TIME
July I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
also O
published O
their O
own O
research O
on O
the O
malware O
. O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
until O
this O
point O
, O
even O
though O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
had O
been O
in O
active O
use O
for O
over O
4 O
years O
, O
and O
had O
undergone O
minor O
modifications O
and O
updates O
during O
that O
time O
, O
even O
the O
most O
recent O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
samples O
would O
often O
embed O
persistence O
components O
that O
date O
back O
to O
2012 S-TIME
. O

These O
samples O
would O
also O
contain O
artefacts O
of O
functionality O
from O
the O
earliest O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
samples O
from O
2010 S-TIME
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
valuable O
to O
observe O
how O
the O
Dukes O
reacted O
to O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
’s O
outing O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
July O
. O

By O
the O
end O
of O
that O
month O
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
samples O
we O
found O
that O
had O
been O
compiled O
on O
the O
30th B-TIME
of I-TIME
July E-TIME
had O
shed O
unused O
parts O
of O
their O
code O
that O
had O
essentially O
just O
been O
relics O
of O
the O
past O
. O

Similarly O
, O
some O
of O
the O
hardcoded O
values O
that O
had O
remained O
unaltered O
in O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
samples O
for O
many O
years O
had O
been O
changed O
. O

We O
believe O
these O
edits O
were O
an O
attempt O
at O
evading O
detection O
by O
modifying O
or O
removing O
parts O
of O
the O
toolset O
that O
the O
authors O
believed O
might O
be O
helpful O
in O
identifying O
and O
detecting O
it O
. O

Concurrently O
with O
the O
alterations O
to O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
were O
also O
hard O
at O
work O
modifying O
their O
trusted O
loader O
. O

Much O
like O
the O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
toolset O
, O
the O
loader O
used O
by O
both O
MiniDuke S-MAL
and O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
had O
previously O
only O
undergone O
one O
major O
update O
( O
the O
Nemesis B-MAL
Gemina E-MAL
upgrade O
) O
since O
the O
first O
known O
samples O
from O
2010 S-TIME
. O

Again O
, O
much O
of O
the O
modification O
work O
focused O
on O
removing O
redundant O
code O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
appear O
different O
from O
earlier O
versions O
of O
the O
loader O
. O

Interestingly O
however O
, O
another O
apparent O
evasion O
trick O
was O
also O
attempted O
- O
forging O
of O
the O
loaders O
’ O
compilation O
timestamps O
. O

The O
first O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
sample O
we O
observed O
after O
the O
initial O
research O
on O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
was O
a O
sample O
compiled O
on O
the O
30th B-TIME
of I-TIME
July I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
. O

The O
loader O
used O
by O
the O
sample O
purported O
to O
have O
been O
compiled O
on O
the O
25th B-TIME
of I-TIME
March I-TIME
2010 E-TIME
. O

Due O
to O
artefacts O
left O
in O
the O
loader O
during O
compilation O
time O
however O
, O
we O
know O
that O
it O
used O
a O
specific O
version O
of O
the O
Boost S-TOOL
library O
, O
1.54.0 O
, O
that O
was O
only O
published O
on O
the O
1st B-TIME
of I-TIME
July I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
. O

The O
compilation O
timestamp O
therefore O
had O
to O
have O
been O
faked O
. O

F-Secure S-SECTEAM
’s O
whitepaper O
on O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
includes O
a O
timeline O
of O
the O
loader O
’s O
usage O
, O
based O
on O
compilation O
timestamps O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
Dukes S-APT
group O
thought O
that O
by O
faking O
a O
timestamp O
from O
before O
the O
earliest O
one O
cited O
in O
the O
whitepaper O
, O
they O
might O
be O
able O
to O
confuse O
researchers O
. O

During O
the O
rest B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
and O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2015 E-TIME
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
continued O
making O
similar O
evasionfocused O
modifications O
to O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
, O
as O
well O
as O
experimenting O
with O
ways O
to O
obfuscate O
the O
loader O
. O

In O
the O
latter O
case O
however O
, O
the O
group O
appear O
to O
have O
also O
simultaneously O
developed O
an O
entirely O
new O
loader O
, O
which O
we O
first O
observed O
being O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
during O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2015 E-TIME
. O

While O
it O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
the O
Dukes S-APT
reacted O
to O
multiple O
companies O
publishing O
extensive O
reports O
on O
one O
of O
their O
key O
toolsets O
, O
it O
is O
valuable O
to O
note O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
they O
responded O
. O

Much O
like O
the O
MiniDuke S-MAL
expose O
in O
February B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
again O
appeared O
to O
prioritize O
continuing O
operations O
over O
staying O
hidden O
. O

They O
could O
have O
ceased O
all O
use O
of O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
( O
at O
least O
until O
they O
had O
developed O
a O
new O
loader O
) O
or O
retired O
it O
entirely O
, O
since O
they O
still O
had O
other O
toolsets O
available O
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
opted O
for O
minimal O
downtime O
and O
attempted O
to O
continue O
operations O
, O
with O
only O
minor O
modifications O
to O
the O
toolset O
. O

While O
we O
now O
know O
that O
CozyDuke S-MAL
had O
been O
under O
development O
since O
at O
least O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME
2011 E-TIME
, O
it O
was O
not O
until O
the O
early O
days O
of O
July B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
that O
the O
first O
large-scale O
CozyDuke S-MAL
campaign O
that O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
took O
place O
. O

This O
campaign O
, O
like O
later O
CozyDuke S-MAL
campaigns O
, O
began O
with O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
that O
tried O
to O
impersonate O
commonly O
seen O
spam O
emails S-TOOL
. O

These O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
would O
contain O
links O
that O
eventually O
lead O
the O
victim O
to O
becoming O
infected O
with O
CozyDuke S-MAL
. O

Some O
of O
the O
CozyDuke S-MAL
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
from O
early O
July S-TIME
posed O
as O
e-fax S-TOOL
arrival O

, O
a O
popular O
theme O
for O
spam O

, O
and O
used O
the O
same O
“ O

decoy O
document O
that O
was O
used O
a O
year O
later O
by O
CloudDuke S-MAL
. O

In O
at O
least O
one O
case O
however O
, O
the O
email S-TOOL
instead O
contained O
a O
link O
to O
a O
zip S-TOOL

named O
“ O

On O

October I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
Leviathan B-SECTEAM

this O
way O
would O
result O
in O
the O

. O

On O
the O
14th B-TIME
of I-TIME
November E-TIME
, O
F-Secure S-SECTEAM
published O
a O
blog O
post O
naming O
the O
malware O
OnionDuke S-MAL
and O
associating O
it O
with O
MiniDuke S-MAL
and O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
, O
the O
other O
Duke S-APT
toolsets O
known O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
investigations O
into O
OnionDuke S-MAL
, O
we O
believe O
that O
for O
about O
7 O
months O
, O
from O
April B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
to O
when O
Leviathan S-SECTEAM
published O
their O
blog O
post O
in O
October B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
the O
Tor S-TOOL
exit O
node O
identified O
by O
the O
researchers O
was O
being O
used O
to O
wrap O
executables O
on-the-fly O
with O
OnionDuke S-MAL
( O
image O
7 O
, O
page O
13 O
) O
. O

This O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
way O
in O
which O
the O
toolset O
was O
being O
spread O
via O
trojanized O
applications O
in O
torrent O
files O
during O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
. O

While O
investigating O
the O
OnionDuke S-MAL
variant O
being O
spread O
by O
the O
malicious O
Tor S-TOOL
node O
, O
we O
also O
identified O
another O
OnionDuke S-MAL
variant O
that O
appeared O
to O
have O
successfully O
compromised O
multiple O
victims O
in O
the O
ministry O
of O
foreign O
affairs O
of O
an O
Eastern O
European O
country O
during O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
. O

This O
variant O
differed O
significantly O
in O
functionality O
from O
the O
one O
being O
spread O
via O
the O
Tor S-TOOL
node O
, O
further O
suggesting O
that O
different O
OnionDuke S-MAL
variants O
are O
intended O
for O
different O
kinds O
of O
victims O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
, O
unusually O
, O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
OnionDuke S-MAL
variant O
spread O
via O
the O
Tor S-TOOL
node O
was O
not O
to O
pursue O
targeted O
attacks O
but O
instead O
to O
form O
a O
small O
botnet O
for O
later O
use O
. O

This O
OnionDuke S-MAL
variant O
is O
related O
to O
the O
one O
seen O
during O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2013 E-TIME
being O
spread O
via O
torrent O
files O
. O

Both O
of O
these O
infection O
vectors O
are O
highly O
indiscriminate O
and O
untargeted O
when O
compared O
to O
spearphishing S-ACT
, O
the O
usual O
infection O
vector O
of O
choice O
for O
the O
Dukes S-APT
. O

Further O
, O
the O
functionality O
of O
the O
OnionDuke S-MAL
variant O
is O
derived O
from O
a O
number O
of O
modules O
. O

While O
one O
of O
these O
modules O
gathers O
system O
information O
and O
another O
attempts O
to O
steal O
the O
victim O
’s O
usernames O
and O
passwords O
, O
as O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
malware O
used O
for O
a O
targeted O
attack O
, O
the O
other O
two O
known O
OnionDuke S-MAL
modules O
are O
quite O
the O
opposite O
; O
one O
is O
designed O
for O
use O
in O
DoS S-TOOL B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
and O
the O
other O
for O
posting O
predetermined O
messages O
to O
the O
Russian O
VKontakte S-TOOL
social O
media O
site O
. O

This O
sort O
of O
functionality O
is O
more O
common O
in O
criminality-oriented O
botnets O
, O
not O
statesponsored O
targeted O
attacks O
. O

We O
have O
since O
been O
able O
to O
identify O
at O
least O
two O
separate O
OnionDuke S-MAL
botnets O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
first O
of O
these O
botnets O
began O
in O
January B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
using O
both O
unidentified O
infection O
vectors O
and O
the O
known O
malicious O
Tor S-TOOL
node O
, O
and O
continued O
until O
our O
blogpost O
was O
published O
in O
November S-TIME
. O

We O
believe O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
second O
botnet O
began O
in O
August B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
and O
continued O
until O
January B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
. O

We O
have O
been O
unable O
to O
identify O
the O
infection O
vectors O
used O
for O
this O
second O
botnet O
, O
but O
the O
C&C S-TOOL
servers O
it O
used O
had O
open O
directory O
listings O
, O
allowing O
us O
to O
retrieve O
files O
containing O
listings O
of O
victim O
IP O
addresses O
. O

The O
geographic O
distribution O
of O
these O
IP O
addresses O
( O
image O
8 O
, O
page O
13 O
) O
further O
supports O
our O
theory O
that O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
OnionDuke S-MAL
variant O
was O
not O
targeted O
attacks O
against O
high-profile O
targets O
. O

One O
theory O
is O
that O
the O
botnets O
were O
a O
criminal O
side O
business O
for O
the O
Dukes S-APT
group O
. O

The O
size O
of O
the O
botnet O
however O
( O
about O
1400 O
bots O
) O
is O
very O
small O
if O
its O
intended O
use O
is O
for O
commercial O
DoS S-TOOL
attacks O
or O
spam-sending O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
OnionDuke S-MAL
also O
steals O
user O
credentials O
from O
its O
victims O
, O
providing O
another O
potential O
revenue O
source O
. O

The O
counter O
to O
that O
argument O
however O
is O
that O
the O
value O
of O
stolen O
credentials O
from O
users O
in O
the O
countries O
with O
the O
highest O
percentage O
of O
OnionDuke S-MAL
bots O
( O
Mongolia S-LOC
and O
India S-LOC
) O
are O
among O
the O
lowest O
on O
underground O
markets O
. O
2015 S-TIME
: O
The O
Dukes S-APT
up O
the O
ante O
. O

The O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME
January I-TIME
2015 E-TIME
saw O
the O
start O
of O
the O
most O
high- O
volume O
Duke S-APT
campaign O
seen O
thus O
far O
, O
with O
thousands O
of O
recipients O
being O
sent O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
that O
contained O
links O
to O
compromised O
websites O
hosting O
CozyDuke S-MAL
. O

Curiously O
, O
the O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
were O
strikingly O
similar O
to O
the O
e-fax O
themed O
spam O
usually O
seen O
spreading O
ransomware O
and O
other O
common O
crimeware O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
sheer O
number O
of O
recipients O
, O
it O
may O
not O
have O
been O
possible O
to O
customize O
the O
emails S-TOOL
in O
the O
same O
way O
as O
was O
possible O
with O
lower-volume O
campaigns O
. O

The O
similarity O
to O
common O
spam O
may O
however O
also O
serve O
a O
more O
devious O
purpose O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
imagine O
a O
security O
analyst O
, O
burdened O
by O
the O
amount O
of O
attacks O
against O
their O
network O
, O
dismissing O
such O
common-looking O
spam O
as O
“ O
just O
another O
crimeware O
spam O
run O
” O
, O
allowing O
the O
campaign O
to O
, O
in O
essence O
, O
hide O
in O
the O
masses O
. O

The O
CozyDuke S-MAL
activity O
continues O
one O
of O
the O
long-running O
trends O
of O
the O
Dukes S-APT
operations O
, O
the O
use O
of O
multiple O
malware O
toolsets O
against O
a O
single O
target O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
first O
attempted O
to O
infect O
large O
numbers O
of O
potential O
targets O
with O
CozyDuke S-MAL
( O
and O
in O
a O
more O
obvious O
manner O
than O
previously O
seen O
) O
. O

They O
would O
then O
use O
the O
toolset O
to O
gather O
initial O
information O
on O
the O
victims O
, O
before O
deciding O
which O
ones O
to O
pursue O
further O
. O

For O
the O
victims O
deemed O
interesting O
enough O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
would O
then O
deploy O
a O
different O
toolset O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
primary O
purpose O
of O
this O
tactic O
is O
an O
attempt O
at O
evading O
detection O
in O
the O
targeted O
network O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
noisy O
initial O
CozyDuke S-MAL
campaign O
is O
noticed O
by O
the O
victim O
organization O
, O
or O
by O
someone O
else O
who O
then O
makes O
it O
publicly O
known O
, O
defenders O
will O
begin O
by O
first O
looking O
for O
indicators B-TOOL
of I-TOOL
compromise E-TOOL
( O
IOCs S-TOOL
) O
related O
to O
the O
CozyDuke S-MAL
toolset O
. O

If O
however O
by O
that O
time O
the O
Dukes S-APT
are O
already O
operating O
within O
the O
victim O
’s O
network O
, O
using O
an O
another O
toolset O
with O
different O
IOCs S-TOOL
, O
then O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
assume O
that O
it O
will O
take O
much O
longer O
for O
the O
victim O
organization O
to O
notice O
the O
infiltration O
. O

In O
previous O
cases O
, O
the O
group O
used O
their O
malware O
toolsets O
interchangeably O
, O
as O
either O
the O
initial O
or O
a O
later-stage O
toolset O
in O
a O
campaign O
. O

For O
these O
CozyDuke S-MAL
campaigns O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
appear O
to O
have O
employed O
two O
particular O
later-stage O
toolsets O
, O
SeaDuke S-MAL
and O
HammerDuke S-MAL
, O
that O
were O
purposely O
designed O
to O
leave O
a O
persistent O
backdoor O
on O
the O
compromised O
network O
. O

HammerDuke S-MAL
is O
a O
set O
of O
backdoors O
that O
was O
first O
seen O
in O
the O
wild O
in O
February B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
, O
while O
SeaDuke S-MAL
is O
a O
crossplatform O
backdoor O
that O
was O
, O
according O
to O
Symantec S-SECTEAM
, O
first O
spotted O
in O
the O
wild O
in O
October B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
. O

Both O
toolsets O
were O
originally O
spotted O
being O
deployed O
by O
CozyDuke S-MAL
to O
its O
victims O
. O

What O
makes O
SeaDuke S-MAL
special O
is O
that O
it O
was O
written O
in O
Python S-TOOL
and O
designed O
to O
work O
on O
both O
Windows S-OS
and O
Linux S-OS
systems O
; O
it O
is O
the O
first O
cross-platform O
tool O
we O
have O
seen O
from O
the O
Dukes S-APT
. O

One O
plausible O
reason O
for O
developing O
such O
a O
flexible O
malware O
might O
be O
that O
the O
group O
were O
increasingly O
encountering O
victim O
environments O
where O
users O
were O
using O
Linux S-OS
as O
their O
desktop O
operating O
system O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
HammerDuke S-MAL
is O
a O
Windows S-OS
only O
malware O
( O
written O
in O
.NET S-TOOL
) O
and O
comes O
in O
two O
variants O
. O

The O
simpler O
one O
will O
connect O
to O
a O
hardcoded O
C&C S-TOOL
server O
over O
HTTP S-PROT
or O
HTTPS S-PROT
to O
download O
commands O
to O
execute O
. O

The O
more O
advanced O
variant O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
will O
use O
an O
algorithm O
to O
generate O
a O
periodically-changing O
Twitter S-TOOL
account O
name O
and O
will O
then O
attempt O
to O
find O
tweets O
from O
that O
account O
containing O
links O
to O
the O
actual O
download O
location O
of O
the O
commands O
to O
execute O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
the O
advanced O
HammerDuke S-MAL
variant O
attempts O
to O
hide O
its O
network O
traffic O
in O
more O
legitimate O
use O
of O
Twitter S-TOOL
. O

This O
method O
is O
not O
unique O
to O
HammerDuke S-MAL
, O
as O
MiniDuke S-MAL
, O
OnionDuke S-MAL
, O
and O
CozyDuke S-MAL
all O
support O
similar O
use O
of O
Twitter S-TOOL
( O

to O

to O
additional O

or O
commands O
. O
2015 S-TIME

CloudDuke S-MAL
. O

In O
the O
beginning B-TIME
of I-TIME
July I-TIME
2015 E-TIME
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
embarked O
on O
yet O
another O
large-scale O
phishing S-ACT
campaign O
. O

The O
malware O
toolset O
used O
for O
this O
campaign O
was O
the O
previously O
unseen O
CloudDuke S-MAL
and O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
July S-TIME
campaign O
marks O
the O
first O
time O
that O
this O
toolset O
was O
deployed O
by O
the O
Dukes S-APT
, O
other O
than O
possible O
small-scale O
testing O
. O

The O
CloudDuke S-MAL
toolset O
consists O
of O
at O
least O
a O
loader S-MAL
, O
a O
downloader S-MAL
, O
and O
two O
backdoor O
variants O
. O

Both O
backdoors O
( O
internally O
referred O
to O
by O
their O
authors O
as O
“ O
BastionSolution S-MAL
” O
and O
“ O
OneDriveSolution S-MAL
” O
) O
essentially O
allow O
the O
operator O
to O
remotely O
execute O
commands O
on O
the O
compromised O
machine O
. O

The O
way O
in O
which O
each O
backdoor O
does O
so O
however O
is O
significantly O
different O
. O

While O
the O
BastionSolution S-MAL
variant O
simply O
retrieves O
commands O
from O
a O
hard-coded O
C&C S-TOOL
server O
controlled O
by O
the O
Dukes S-APT
, O
the O
OneDriveSolution S-MAL
utilizes O
Microsoft S-IDTY
’s O
OneDrive S-TOOL
cloud O
storage O
service O
for O
communicating O
with O
its O
masters O
, O
making O
it O
significantly O
harder O
for O
defenders O
to O
notice O
the O
traffic O
and O
block O
the O
communication O
channel O
. O

What O
is O
most O
significant O
about O
the O
July B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
CloudDuke S-MAL
campaign O
is O
the O
timeline O
. O

The O
campaign O
appeared O
to O

two O

of O
spear-phishing S-ACT

Details O
of O
the O
first O

including O
a O
thorough O
technical O

of O

, O
was O
published O
by O
Palo B-SECTEAM

This O
was O
followed O
by O
additional O
details O
from O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
in O
a O
blog O
post O
published O
on O
16th B-TIME
July E-TIME
. O

Both O
publications O
happened O
before O
the O
second O
wave O
took O
place O
and O
received O
notable O
publicity O
. O

Despite O
the O
attention O
and O
public O
exposure O
of O
the O
toolset O
’s O
technical O
details O
( O
including O
IOCs S-TOOL
) O
to O
defenders O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
still O
continued O
with O
their O
second O
wave O
of O
spear-phishing S-ACT
, O
including O
the O
continued O
use O
of O
CloudDuke S-MAL
. O

The O
group O
did O
change O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
they O
sent O
, O
but O
they O
didn’t O
switch O
to O
a O
new O
email S-TOOL
format O
; O
instead O
, O
they O
reverted O
to O
the O
same O
efaxthemed O
format O
that O
they O
had O
previously O
employed O
, O
even O
to O
the O
point O
of O
reusing O
the O
exact O
same O
decoy O
document O
that O
they O
had O
used O
in O
the O
CozyDuke S-MAL
campaign O
a O
year O
earlier O
( O
July B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
) O
. O

This O
once O
more O
highlights O
two O
crucial O
behavioral O
elements O
of O
the O
Dukes S-APT
group O
. O

Firstly O
, O
as O
with O
the O
MiniDuke S-MAL
campaigns O
of O
February B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
and O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
campaigns O
in O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
again O
the O
group O
clearly O
prioritized O
the O
continuation O
of O
their O
operations O
over O
maintaining O
stealth O
. O

Secondly O
, O
it O
underlines O
their O
boldness O
, O
arrogance O
and O
self-confidence O
; O
they O
are O
clearly O
confident O
in O
both O
their O
ability O
to O
compromise O
their O
targets O
even O
when O
their O
tools O
and O
techniques O
are O
already O
publicly O
known O
, O
and O
critically O
, O
they O
appear O
to O
be O
extremely O
confident O
in O
their O
ability O
to O
act O
with O
impunity O
. O
2015 S-TIME
: O
Continuing O
surgical O
strikes O
with O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
notably O
overt O
and O
large-scale O
campaigns O
with O
CozyDuke S-MAL
and O
CloudDuke S-MAL
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
also O
continued O
to O
engage O
in O
more O
covert O
, O
surgical O
campaigns O
using O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
. O

The O
latest O
of O
these O
campaigns O
that O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
occurred O
during O
the O
spring S-TIME
and O
early B-TIME
summer I-TIME
of I-TIME
2015 E-TIME
. O

As O
their O
infection O
vectors O
, O
these O
campaigns O
used O
malicious O
documents O
exploiting O
recently O
fixed O
vulnerabilities O
. O

Two O
of O
these O
campaigns O
were O
detailed O
in O
separate O
blog O
posts O
by O
the O
Polish O
security O
company O
Prevenity S-SECTEAM
, O
who O
said O
that O
both O
campaigns O
targeted O
Polish O
entities O
with O
spear- B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
emails S-TOOL
containing O
malicious O
attachments O
with O
relevant O
Polish O
language O
names O
. O

A O
third O
, O
similar O
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
campaign O
was O
observed O
presumably O
targeting O
Georgian S-LOC
entities O
since O
it O
used O
an O
attachment O
with O
a O
Georgian-language O
name O
that O
translates O
to O
“ O
NATO B-FILE
consolidates I-FILE
control I-FILE
of I-FILE
the I-FILE
Black I-FILE
Sea.docx E-FILE
” O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
, O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
Dukes S-APT
are O
replacing O
their O
covert O
and O
targeted O
campaigns O
with O
the O
overt O
and O
opportunistic O
CozyDuke S-MAL
and O
CloudDuke S-MAL
style O
of O
campaigns O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
they O
are O
simply O
expanding O
their O
activities O
by O
adding O
new O
tools O
and O
techniques O
. O

FireEye S-SECTEAM
recently O
published O
a O
blog O
covering O
the O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
, O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
for O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
when O
preparing O
to O
deploy O
the O
TRITON S-MAL
/ O
TRISIS S-MAL
malware O
framework O
in O
2017 S-TIME
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
post O
does O
a O
commendable O
job O
in O
making O
public O
findings O
previously O
only O
privately O
shared O
( O
presumably O
by O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
, O
and O
in O
several O
reports O
I O
authored O
for O
my O
employer O
, O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
) O
to O
threat O
intelligence O
customers O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
blog O
continues O
to O
push O
forward O
the O
narrative O
of O
how O
ICS S-TOOL
attacks O
are O
enabled O
through O
prepositioning O
and O
initial O
intrusion O
operations O
– O
an O
item O
I O
have O
discussed O
at O
length O
. O

Yet O
one O
point O
of O
confusion O
in O
the O
blog O
comes O
at O
the O
very O
start O
: O
referring O
to O
the O
entity O
responsible O
for O
TRITON S-MAL
as O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
. O

This O
seems O
confusing O
as O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
earlier O
publicly O
declared O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
as O
a O
discrete O
entity O
, O
linked O
to O
a O
Russian O
research O
institution O
, O
and O
christened O
it O
as O
“ O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
” O
. O

In O
the O
2018 S-TIME
public O
posting O
announcing O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
researchers O
noted O
that O
the O
institute O
in O
question O
at O
least O
supported O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
activity O
in O
deploying O
TRITON S-MAL
, O
with O
subsequent O
public O
presentations O
at O
Cyberwarcon S-SECTEAM
and O
the O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Lab E-SECTEAM
sponsored O
Security B-SECTEAM
Analyst I-SECTEAM
Summit E-SECTEAM
essentially O
linking O
TRITON S-MAL
and O
the O
research O
institute O
( O
and O
therefore O
TEMP.Veles S-MAL
) O
as O
one O
in O
the O
same O
. O

Yet O
the O
most-recent O
posting O
covering O
TTPs O
from O
initial O
access O
through O
prerequisites O
to O
enable O
final O
delivery O
of O
effects O
on O
target O
( O
deploying O
TRITON S-MAL
/ O
TRISIS S-MAL
) O
avoids O
the O
use O
of O
the O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
term O
entirely O
. O

In O
subsequent O
discussion O
, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
personnel O
indicate O
that O
there O
was O
not O
“ O
an O
avalanche O
of O
evidence O
to O
substantiate O
” O
anything O
more O
than O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
– O
summing O
matters O
by O
indicating O
this O
term O
“ O
is O
the O
best O
we O
’ve O
got O
for O
the O
public O
for O
now O
” O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
parallel O
work O
at O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
( O
my O
employer O
, O
where O
I O
have O
performed O
significant O
work O
on O
the O
activity O
described O
above O
) O
uncovered O
similar O
conclusions O
concerning O
TTPs O
and O
behaviors O
, O
for O
both O
the O
2017 S-TIME
event O
and O
subsequent O
activity O
in O
other O
industrial O
sectors O
. O

Utilizing O
Diamond B-TOOL
Model E-TOOL
methodology O
for O
characterizing O
activity O
by O
behaviors O
attached O
to O
victims O
, O
we O
began O
tracking O
TRITON S-MAL
/ O
TRISIS S-MAL
and O
immediate O
enabling O
activity O
as O
a O
distinct O
activity O
group O
( O
collection O
of O
behaviors O
, O
infrastructure O
, O
and O
victimology O
) O
designated O
XENOTIME S-APT
. O

Based O
on O
information O
gained O
from O
discussion O
with O
the O
initial O
TRITON S-MAL
/ O
TRISIS S-MAL
responders O
and O
subsequent O
work O
on O
follow-on O
activity O
by O
this O
entity O
, O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
developed O
a O
comprehensive O
( O
public O
) O
picture O
of O
adversary O
activity O
roughly O
matching O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
analysis O
published O
in O
April B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
, O
described O
in O
various O
media O
. O

At O
this O
stage O
, O
we O
have O
two O
similar O
, O
parallel O
constructions O
of O
events O
– O
the O
how O
behind O
the O
immediate O
deployment O
and O
execution O
of O
TRITON S-MAL
/ O
TRISIS S-MAL
– O
yet O
dramatically O
different O
responses O
in O
terms O
of O
attribution O
and O
labeling O
. O

Since O
late B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
, O
based O
upon O
the O
most-recent O
posting O
, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
appears O
to O
have O
“ O
walked O
back O
” O
the O
previously-used O
terminology O
of O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
and O
instead O
refers O
rather O
cryptically O
to O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
, O
while O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
leveraged O
identified O
behaviors O
to O
consistently O
refer O
to O
an O
activity O
group O
, O
XENOTIME S-APT
. O

Given O
that O
both O
organizations O
appear O
to O
describe O
similar O
( O
if O
not O
identical O
) O
activity O
, O
any O
reasonable O
person O
could O
( O
and O
should O
) O
ask O
– O
why O
the O
inconsistency O
in O
naming O
and O
identification O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
competitive O
vendor O
naming O
landscape O
( O
which O
I O
am O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
in O
cases O
on O
direct O
overlap O
, O
but O
which O
has O
more O
to O
say O
for O
itself O
when O
different O
methodologies O
are O
employed O
around O
similar O
observations O
) O
, O
the O
distinction O
between O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
and O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
’ O
approaches O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
comes O
down O
to O
fundamental O
philosophical O
differences O
in O
methodology O
. O

As O
wonderfully O
described O
in O
a O
recent O
public O
posting O
, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
adheres O
to O
a O
naming O
convention O
based O
upon O
extensive O
data O
collection O
and O
activity O
comparison O
, O
designed O
to O
yield O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
discrete O
, O
identifiable O
entity O
responsible O
for O
a O
given O
collection O
of O
activity O
. O

This O
technique O
is O
precise O
and O
praiseworthy O
– O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
appears O
so O
rigorous O
as O
to O
impose O
limitations O
on O
the O
ability O
to O
dynamically O
adjust O
and O
adapt O
to O
emerging O
adversary O
activity O
. O
( O
Or O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
even O
categorize O
otherwise O
well-known O
historical O
actors O
operating O
to O
the O
present O
day O
, O
such O
as O
Turla S-APT
. O
) O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
methodology O
may O
have O
particular O
limitations O
in O
instances O
where O
adversaries O
( O
such O
as O
XENOTIME S-APT
and O
presumably O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
) O
rely O
upon O
extensive O
use O
of O
publicly-available O
, O
commonly-used O
tools O
with O
limited O
amounts O
of O
customization O
. O

In O
such O
cases O
, O
utilizing O
purely O
technical O
approaches O
for O
differentiation O
( O
an O
issue O
I O
lightly O
touched O
on O
in O
a O
recent O
post O
) O
becomes O
problematic O
, O
especially O
when O
trying O
to O
define O
attribution O
to O
specific O
, O
“ O
who-based O
” O
entities O
( O
such O
as O
a O
Russian O
research O
institute O
) O
. O

My O
understanding O
is O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
labels O
entities O
where O
definitive O
attribution O
is O
not O
yet O
possible O
with O
the O
“ O
TEMP O
” O
moniker O
( O
hence O
, O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
) O
– O
yet O
in O
this O
case O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
developed O
and O
deployed O
the O
label O
, O
then O
appeared O
to O
move O
away O
from O
it O
in O
subsequent O
reporting O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
public O
blog O
post O
– O
which O
also O
indicated O
that O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
is O
responding O
to O
an O
intrusion O
at O
a O
second O
facility O
featuring O
the O
same O
or O
similar O
observations O
– O
this O
is O
presumably O
not O
for O
lack O
of O
evidence O
, O
yet O
the O
“ O
downgrade O
” O
occurs O
all O
the O
same O
. O

In O
comparison O
, O
XENOTIME S-APT
was O
defined O
based O
on O
principles O
of O
infrastructure O
( O
compromised O
third-party O
infrastructure O
and O
various O
networks O
associated O
with O
several O
Russian O
research O
institutions O
) O
, O
capabilities O
( O
publicly- O
and O
commercially-available O
tools O
with O
varying O
levels O
of O
customization O
) O
and O
targeting O
( O
an O
issue O
not O
meant O
for O
discussion O
in O
this O
blog O
) O
. O

In O
personally O
responding O
to O
several O
incidents O
across O
multiple O
industry O
sectors O
since O
early B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
matching O
TTPs O
from O
the O
TRITON S-MAL
/ O
TRISIS S-MAL
event O
, O
these O
items O
proved O
consistent O
and O
supported O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
XENOTIME S-APT
activity O
group O
. O

This O
naming O
decision O
was O
founded O
upon O
the O
underlying O
methodology O
described O
in O
the O
Diamond B-TOOL
Model E-TOOL
of O
intrusion O
analysis O
. O

As O
such O
, O
this O
decision O
does O
not O
necessarily O
refer O
to O
a O
specific O
institution O
, O
but O
rather O
a O
collection O
of O
observations O
and O
behaviors O
observed O
across O
multiple O
, O
similarly-situated O
victims O
. O

Of O
note O
, O
this O
methodology O
of O
naming O
abstracts O
away O
the O
“ O
who O
” O
element O
– O
XENOTIME S-APT
may O
represent O
a O
single O
discrete O
entity O
( O
such O
as O
a O
Russian O
research O
institution O
) O
or O
several O
entities O
working O
in O
coordination O
in O
a O
roughly O
repeatable O
, O
similar O
manner O
across O
multiple O
events O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
the O
epistemic O
foundation O
of O
the O
behavior-based O
naming O
approach O
makes O
this O
irrelevant O
for O
tracking O
( O
and O
labeling O
for O
convenience O
sake O
) O
observations O
. O

Much O
like O
the O
observers O
watching O
the O
shadows O
of O
objects O
cast O
upon O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
cave O
, O
these O
two O
definitions O
( O
XENOTIME S-APT
and O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
, O
both O
presumably O
referring O
to O
“ O
the O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
) O
describe O
the O
same O
phenomena O
, O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
appear O
different O
. O

This O
question O
of O
perception O
and O
accuracy O
rests O
upon O
the O
underlying O
epistemic O
framework O
and O
the O
goal O
conceived O
for O
that O
framework O
in O
defining O
an O
adversary O
: O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
methodology O
follows O
a O
deductive O
approach O
requiring O
the O
collection O
of O
significant O
evidence O
over O
time O
to O
yield O
a O
conclusion O
that O
will O
be O
necessary O
given O
the O
premises O
( O
the O
totality O
of O
evidence O
suggests O
APTxx O
) O
; O
the O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
approach O
instead O
seeks O
an O
inductive O
approach O
, O
where O
premises O
may O
all O
be O
true O
but O
the O
conclusion O
need O
not O
necessarily O
follow O
from O
them O
given O
changes O
in O
premises O
over O
time O
or O
other O
observations O
not O
contained O
within O
the O
set O
( O
thus O
, O
identified O
behaviors O
strongly O
suggests O
an O
activity O
group O
, O
defined O
as O
X O
) O
. O

From O
an O
external O
analysts O
’ O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
wonder O
is O
, O
which O
is O
superior O
to O
the O
other O
. O

And O
my O
answer O
for O
this O
is O
: O
neither O
is O
perfect O
, O
but O
both O
are O
useful O
– O
depending O
upon O
your O
goals O
and O
objectives O
. O

But O
rather O
than O
trying O
to O
pursue O
some O
comparison O
between O
the O
two O
for O
identification O
of O
superiority O
( O
an O
approach O
that O
will O
result O
in O
unproductive O
argument O
and O
social O
media O
warring O
) O
, O
the O
point O
of O
this O
post O
is O
to O
highlight O
the O
distinctions O
between O
these O
approaches O
and O
how O
– O
in O
the O
case O
of O
“ O
the O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
– O
they O
result O
in O
noticeably O
different O
conclusions O
from O
similar O
datasets O
. O

One O
reason O
for O
the O
distinction O
may O
be O
differences O
in O
evidence O
, O
as O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
public O
reporting O
notes O
two O
distinct O
events O
of O
which O
they O
are O
aware O
of O
and O
have O
responded O
to O
related O
to O
“ O
the O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
while O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
has O
been O
engaged O
several O
instances O
– O
thus O
, O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
would O
possess O
more O
evidence O
to O
cement O
the O
definition O
of O
an O
activity O
group O
, O
while O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
data O
collection-centric O
approach O
would O
require O
far O
more O
observations O
to O
yield O
an O
“ O
APT O
” O
. O

Yet O
irrespective O
of O
this O
, O
it O
is O
confusing O
why O
the O
previously-declared O
“ O
TEMP O
” O
category O
was O
walked O
back O
as O
this O
has O
led O
to O
not O
small O
amount O
of O
confusion O
– O
in O
both O
technical O
and O
non-technical O
audiences O
– O
as O
to O
just O
what O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
blog O
post O
refers O
. O

Thus O
respected O
journalists O
( O
at O
least O
by O
me O
) O
conflate O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
is O
active O
at O
another O
site O
” O
with O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
malware O
was O
identified O
at O
another O
site O
” O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
we O
’re O
seeing O
a O
definite O
problem O
with O
the O
overly-conservative O
naming O
approach O
used O
as O
it O
engenders O
confusion O
in O
a O
significant O
subset O
of O
the O
intended O
audience O
. O

While O
some O
may O
dismiss O
adversary O
or O
activity O
naming O
as O
so O
much O
marketing O
, O
having O
a O
distinct O
label O
for O
something O
allows O
for O
clearer O
communication O
and O
more O
accurate O
discussion O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
conflating O
adversaries O
with O
tools O
, O
since O
tools O
can O
be O
repurposed O
or O
used O
by O
other O
entities O
than O
those O
first O
observed O
deploying O
them O
, O
leads O
to O
further O
potential O
confusion O
as O
the O
“ O
X O
actor O
” O
is O
quickly O
compressed O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
some O
to O
refer O
to O
any O
and O
all O
instantiations O
of O
tool O
“ O
X O
” O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
discussion O
above O
may O
appear O
so O
much O
splitting O
of O
hairs O
or O
determining O
how O
many O
angels O
can O
dance O
on O
the O
head O
of O
a O
pin O
– O
yet O
given O
the O
communicative O
impacts O
behind O
different O
naming O
and O
labeling O
conventions O
, O
this O
exploration O
seems O
not O
merely O
useful O
but O
necessary O
. O

Understanding O
the O
“ O
how O
” O
and O
“ O
why O
” O
behind O
different O
entity O
classifications O
of O
similar O
( O
or O
even O
the O
same O
) O
activity O
allows O
us O
to O
move O
beyond O
the O
dismissive O
approach O
of O
“ O
everyone O
has O
their O
names O
for O
marketing O
purposes O
” O
to O
a O
more O
productive O
mindset O
that O
grasps O
the O
fundamental O
methodologies O
that O
( O

) O
drive O
these O

FireEye S-SECTEAM
uncovered O
malware O
development O
activity O
that O
is O
very O
likely O
supporting O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
activity O
. O

This O
includes O
testing O
multiple O
versions O
of O
malicious O
software O
, O
some O
of O
which O
were O
used O
by O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
during O
the O
TRITON S-MAL

. O

Investigation O
of O
this O
testing O

reveals O
multiple O
independent O
ties O
to O
Russia S-LOC

CNIIHM S-IDTY
, O
and O
a O

in O
Moscow S-LOC

This O

An O
IP O
address O
registered O

CNIIHM S-IDTY
has O
been O
employed O
by O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
for O
multiple O
purposes O

, O
and O
malicious O

in O
support O
of O
the O
TRITON S-MAL

. O

Behavior O
patterns O
observed O
in O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
activity O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
Moscow S-LOC
time O
zone O
, O
where O
CNIIHM S-IDTY
is O
located O
. O

We O
judge O
that O
CNIIHM S-IDTY
likely O
possesses O
the O
necessary O
institutional O
knowledge O
and O
personnel O
to O
assist O
in O
the O
orchestration O
and O
development O
of O
TRITON S-MAL

TEMP.Veles S-APT
operations O
. O

While O
we O
cannot O
rule O
out O
the O
possibility O
that O
one O
or O
more O
CNIIHM S-IDTY
employees O
could O
have O
conducted O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
activity O
without O
their O
employer O
’s O
approval O
, O
the O
details O
shared O
in O

demonstrate O
that O
this O
explanation O
is O
less O
plausible O
than O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
operating O
with O
the O

of O
the O

. O

During O
our O
investigation O
of O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
activity O
, O
we O
found O
multiple O
unique O

Some O
of O
these O

Industrial O

are O
highly O
redundant O

manage O
industrial O

if O
they O
approach O
unsafe O

such O
as O

They O
enable O

to O
safely O
control O

They O
’re O
a O
critical O

of O
many O
dangerous O
industrial O

Because O

the O
following O
reasons O
, O
CTU S-SECTEAM
researchers O
assess O
with O
moderate O
confidence O
that O
TG-3390 S-APT
has O
a O
Chinese O
nexus O
: O

The O
SWC S-TOOL
of O
a O
Uyghur O
cultural O

suggests O
intent O
to O

the O
Uyghur O
ethnic O

a O
Muslim O
minority O
group O
primarily O
found O
in O
the O
Xinjiang S-LOC

Threat O
groups O
outside O
of O
China S-LOC
are O
unlikely O
to O
target O
the O
Uyghur O
people O
. O

TG-3390 S-APT

the O
PlugX S-MAL
remote O
access O

. O

The O
menus O
for O
PlugX S-MAL

server-side O
component O
are O
written O
exclusively O
in O
Standard B-TOOL
Chinese E-TOOL

, O
suggesting O
that O
PlugX S-MAL
operators O
are O
familiar O
with O
this O

CTU S-SECTEAM

have O
observed O
TG-3390 S-APT

both O
. O

CTU S-SECTEAM
researchers O
recognize O
that O
the O
evidence O
supporting O
this O
attribution O
is O
circumstantial O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
TG-3390 S-APT
is O
false-flag O
operation O
by O
a O
threat O
group O
outside O
of O
China S-LOC
that O
is O
deliberately O
planting O
indications O
of O
a O
Chinese O
origin O
. O

TG-3390 S-APT
has O
access O
to O
proprietary O
tools O
, O
some O
of O
which O
are O
used O
exclusively O
by O
TG-3390 S-APT
and O
others O
that O
are O
shared O
among O
a O
few O
Chinese O
threat O
groups O
. O

The O
complexity O
and O
continual O
development O
of O
these O
tools O
indicates O
a O
mature O
development O
process O
. O

TG-3390 S-APT
can O
quickly O
leverage O
compromised O
network O
infrastructure O
during O
an O
operation O
and O
can O
conduct O
simultaneous O
intrusions O
into O
multiple O
environments O
. O

This O
ability O
is O
further O
demonstrated O
by O
analysis O
of O
interactions O
between O
TG-3390 S-APT
operators O
and O
a O
target O
environment O
. O

CTU S-SECTEAM
researchers O
found O
no O
evidence O
of O
multiple O
operators O
working O
simultaneously O
against O
a O
single O
organization O
. O

This O
efficiency O
of O
operation O
( O
a O
1:1 O
ratio O
of O
operator O
to O
observed O
activity O
) O
suggests O
that O
TG-3390 S-APT
can O
scale O
to O
conduct O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
simultaneous O
operations O
. O

These O
characteristics O
suggest O
that O
the O
threat O
group O
is O
well O
resourced O
and O
has O
access O
to O
a O
tools O
development O
team O
and O
a O

were O
not O
only O
leveraging O

can O
be O
an O
extremely O
valuable O
component O
of O

and O
in O
this O
case O
proved O
crucial O
in O
identifying O
TG-1314 S-APT
's O
actions O
on O

. O

Memory O
collected O
from O

running O
as O
a O
child O
of O
the O

CTU S-SECTEAM
researchers O
immediately O
recognized O
suspicious O
commands O
, O
such O
as O
changing O
the O
working O
directory O
to O
recycler O
and O
executing O
commands O
from O
that O
location O
, O
that O
were O
unlikely O
to O
have O
been O
connected O
to O
legitimate O

also O
revealed O

on O
remote O

To O
better O
understand O
how O
the O
adversary O
was O
operating O
and O
what O
other O
actions O
they O

performed O
, O
CTU S-SECTEAM

While O
cmd.exe S-FILE
is O
a O
console O

it O
still O
requires O
GUI S-TOOL

and O
other O
support O
to O
interact O
with O
the O
operating O

. O

On O
the O
Windows B-OS

platform O
, O
this O
support O
is O
provided O
by O
the O
csrss.exe S-FILE
process O
. O

Because O
commands O
run O
from O
cmd.exe S-FILE
are O
acted O
on O
by O

, O
additional O
evidence O
of O

were O
obtaining O
the O

and O
executing O
their O

binary O
revealed O
evidence O
that O
the O

In O
late B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
, O
Symantec S-SECTEAM
identified O
suspicious O
activity O
involving O
a O
hacking O
tool O
used O
in O
a O
malicious O
manner O
against O
one O
of O
our O
customers O
. O

Normally O
, O
this O
is O
considered O
a O
low-level O
alert O
easily O
defeated O
by O
security O
software O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
however O
, O
the O
hacktool O
had O
an O
unusual O
characteristic O
not O
typically O
seen O
with O
this O
type O
of O
file O
; O
it O
was O
signed O
with O
a O
valid O
code-signing O
certificate O
. O

Many O
hacktools O
are O
made O
for O
less O
than O
ethical O
purposes O
and O
are O
freely O
available O
, O
so O
this O
was O
an O
initial O
red O
flag O
, O
which O
led O
us O
to O
investigate O
further O
. O

As O
our O
investigation O
continued O
, O
we O
soon O
realized O
this O
was O
much O
larger O
than O
a O
few O
hacktools O
. O

We O
discovered O
Suckfly S-APT
, O
an O
advanced O
threat O
group O
, O
conducting O
targeted O
attacks O
using O
multiple O
stolen O
certificates O
, O
as O
well O
as O
hacktools O
and O
custom O
malware O
. O

The O
group O
had O
obtained O
the O
certificates O
through O
pre-attack O
operations O
before O
commencing O
targeted O
attacks O
against O
a O
number O
of O
government O
and O
commercial O
organizations O
spread O
across O
multiple O
continents O
over O
a O
two-year O
period O
. O

This O
type O
of O
activity O
and O
the O
malicious O
use O
of O
stolen O
certificates O
emphasizes O
the O
importance O
of O
safeguarding O
certificates O
to O
prevent O
them O
from O
being O
used O
maliciously O
. O

Suckfly S-APT
has O
a O
number O
of O
hacktools O
and O
malware O
varieties O
at O
its O
disposal O
: O
Back B-TOOL
door E-TOOL
, O
Keylogger S-TOOL
, O
Port B-TOOL
scanner E-TOOL
, O
Misc. S-TOOL
tool O
, O
Exploit S-TOOL
, O
Credential O
dumper S-TOOL
, O
Privilage B-VULNAME
escalation E-VULNAME
. O

The O
first O
signed O
hacktool O
we O
identified O
in O
late B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
was O
a O
digitally O
signed O
brute-force O
server B-TOOL
message I-TOOL
block E-TOOL
( O
SMB S-TOOL
) O
scanner O
. O

The O
organization O
associated O
with O
this O
certificate O
is O
a O
South O
Korean O
mobile O
software O
developer O
. O

While O
we O
became O
initially O
curious O
because O
the O
hacktool O
was O
signed O
, O
we O
became O
more O
suspicious O
when O
we O
realized O
a O
mobile O
software O
developer O
had O
signed O
it O
, O
since O
this O
is O
not O
the O
type O
of O
software O
typically O
associated O
with O
a O
mobile O
application O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
discovery O
, O
we O
began O
to O
look O
for O
other O
binaries O
signed O
with O
the O
South O
Korean O
mobile O
software O
developer's O
certificate O
. O

This O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
three O
additional O
hacktools O
also O
signed O
using O
this O
certificate O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
being O
signed O
with O
a O
stolen O
certificate O
, O
the O
identified O
hacktools O
had O
been O
used O
in O
suspicious O
activity O
against O
a O
US S-LOC
based O
health O
provider O
operating O
in O
India S-LOC
. O

This O
evidence O
indicates O
that O
the O
certificate O
’s O
rightful O
owner O
either O
misused O
it O
or O
it O
had O
been O
stolen O
from O
them O
. O

Symantec S-SECTEAM
worked O
with O
the O
certificate O
owner O
to O
confirm O
that O
the O
hacktool O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
them O
. O

Following O
the O
trail O
further O
, O
we O
traced O
malicious O
traffic O
back O
to O
where O
it O
originated O
from O
and O
looked O
for O
additional O
evidence O
to O
indicate O
that O
the O
attacker O
persistently O
used O
the O
same O
infrastructure O
. O

We O
discovered O
the O
activity O
originated O
from O
three O
separate O
IP S-PROT
addresses O
, O
all O
located O
in O
Chengdu S-LOC
, O
China S-LOC
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
traffic O
originating O
from O
Chengdu S-LOC
, O
we O
identified O
a O
selection O
of O
hacktools O
and O
malware O
signed O
using O
nine O
stolen O
certificates O
. O

The O
nine O
stolen O
certificates O
originated O
from O
nine O
different O
companies O
who O
are O
physically O
located O
close O
together O
around O
the O
central O
districts O
of O
Seoul S-LOC
, O
South B-LOC
Korea E-LOC
. O

We O
don't O
know O
the O
exact O
date O
Suckfly S-APT
stole O
the O
certificates O
from O
the O
South O
Korean O
organizations O
. O

However O
, O
by O
analyzing O
the O
dates O
when O
we O
first O
saw O
the O
certificates O
paired O
with O
hacktools O
or O
malware O
, O
we O
can O
gain O
insight O
into O
when O
the O
certificates O
may O
have O
been O
stolen O
. O

Figure O
4 O
details O
how O
many O
times O
each O
stolen O
certificate O
was O
used O
in O
a O
given O
month O
. O

The O
first O
sighting O
of O
three O
of O
the O
nine O
stolen O
certificates O
being O
used O
maliciously O
occurred O
in O
early B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
. O

Those O
three O
certificates O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
used O
in O
2014 S-TIME
, O
making O
it O
likely O
that O
the O
other O
six O
were O
not O
compromised O
until O
2015 S-TIME
. O

All O
nine O
certificates O
were O
used O
maliciously O
in O
2015 S-TIME
. O

As O
noted O
earlier O
, O
the O
stolen O
certificates O
Symantec S-SECTEAM
identified O
in O
this O
investigation O
were O
used O
to O
sign O
both O
hacking O
tools O
and O
malware O
. O

Further O
analysis O
of O
the O
malware O
identified O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
custom O
back B-TOOL
door E-TOOL
. O

We O
believe O
Suckfly S-APT
specifically O
developed O
the O
back B-TOOL
door E-TOOL
for O
use O
in O
cyberespionage O
campaigns O
. O

Symantec S-SECTEAM
detects O
this O
threat O
as O
Backdoor.Nidiran S-MAL
. O

Analysis O
of O
Nidiran S-MAL
samples O
determined O
that O
the O
back B-TOOL
door E-TOOL
had O
been O
updated O
three O
times O
since O
early B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
which O
fits O
the O
timeline O
outlined O
in O
Figure O
4 O
. O

The O
modifications O
were O
minor O
and O
likely O
performed O
to O
add O
capabilities O
and O
avoid O
detection O
. O

While O
the O
malware O
is O
custom O
, O
it O
only O
provides O
the O
attackers O
with O
standard O
back B-TOOL
door E-TOOL
capabilities O
. O

Suckfly S-APT
delivered O
Nidiran S-MAL
through O
a O
strategic O
web O
compromise O
. O

Specifically O
, O
the O
threat O
group O
used O
a O
specially O
crafted O
web O
page O
to O
deliver O
an O
exploit O
for O
the O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Windows S-OS
OLE B-TOOL
Remote E-TOOL
Code O
Execution O
Vulnerability O
( O
CVE-2014-6332 S-VULID
) O
, O
which O
affects O
specific O
versions O
of O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Windows S-OS
. O

This O
exploit O
is O
triggered O
when O
a O
potential O
victim O
browses O
to O
a O
malicious O
page O
using O
Internet B-TOOL
Explorer E-TOOL
, O
which O
can O
allow O
the O
attacker O
to O
execute O
code O
with O
the O
same O
privileges O
as O
the O
currently O
logged-in O
user O
. O

Once O
exploit O
has O
been O
achieved O
, O
Nidiran S-MAL
is O
delivered O
through O
a O
self-extracting O
executable O
that O
extracts O
the O
components O
to O
a O
.tmp S-FILE
folder O
after O
it O
has O
been O
executed O
. O

The O
threat O
then O
executes O
“ O
svchost.exe S-FILE
” O
, O
a O
PE S-TOOL
file O
, O
which O
is O
actually O
a O
clean O
tool O
known O
as O
OLEVIEW.EXE S-FILE
. O

The O
executable O
will O
then O
load O
iviewers.dll S-FILE
, O
which O
is O
normally O
a O
clean O
, O
legitimate O
file O
. O

Attackers O
have O
been O
known O
to O
distribute O
malicious O
files O
masquerading O
as O
the O
legitimate O
iviewers.dll S-FILE
file O
and O
then O
use O
DLL S-TOOL
load O
hijacking O
to O
execute O
the O
malicious O
code O
and O
infect O
the O
computer O
. O

This O
technique O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
Korplug S-MAL/Plug-x S-MAL
malware O
and O
is O
frequently O
used O
in O
China S-LOC
based O
cyberespionage O
activity O
. O

Suckfly S-APT
isn’t O
the O
only O
attack O
group O
to O
use O
certificates O
to O
sign O
malware O
but O
they O
may O
be O
the O
most O
prolific O
collectors O
of O
them O
. O

After O
all O
, O
Stuxnet S-VULNAME
, O
widely O
regarded O
as O
the O
world O
’s O
first O
known O
cyberweapon O
, O
was O
signed O
using O
stolen O
certificates O
from O
companies O
based O
in O
Taiwan S-LOC
with O
dates O
much O
earlier O
than O
Suckfly S-APT
. O

Other O
cyberespionage O
groups O
, O
including O
Black B-APT
Vine E-APT
and O
Hidden B-APT
Lynx E-APT
, O
have O
also O
used O
stolen O
certificates O
in O
their O
campaigns O
. O

In O
April B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
, O
a O
third-party O
vendor O
published O
a O
report O
about O
a O
cyberespionage O
group O
using O
custom O
malware O
and O
stolen O
certificates O
in O
their O
operations O
. O

The O
report O
documented O
an O
advanced O
threat O
group O
they O
attributed O
to O
China S-LOC
. O

Symantec S-SECTEAM
tracks O
the O
group O
behind O
this O
activity O
as O
Blackfly S-APT
and O
detects O
the O
malware O
they O
use O
as O
Backdoor.Winnti S-MAL
. O

The O
Blackfly S-APT
attacks O
share O
some O
similarities O
with O
the O
more O
recent O
Suckfly S-APT
attacks O
. O

Blackfly S-APT
began O
with O
a O
campaign O
to O
steal O
certificates O
, O
which O
were O
later O
used O
to O
sign O
malware O
used O
in O
targeted O
attacks O
. O

The O
certificates O
Blackfly S-APT
stole O
were O
also O
from O
South O
Korean O
companies O
, O
primarily O
in O
the O
video O
game O
and O
software O
development O
industry O
. O

Another O
similarity O
is O
that O
Suckfly S-APT
stole O
a O
certificate O
from O
Company O
D O
( O
see O
Figure O
4 O
) O
less O
than O
two O
years O
after O
Blackfly S-APT
had O
stolen O
a O
certificate O
from O
the O
same O
company O
. O

While O
the O
stolen O
certificates O
were O
different O
, O
and O
stolen O
in O
separate O
instances O
, O
they O
were O
both O
used O
with O
custom O
malware O
in O
targeted O
attacks O
originating O
from O
China S-LOC
. O

Signing O
malware O
with O
code-signing O
certificates O
is O
becoming O
more O
common O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
this O
investigation O
and O
the O
other O
attacks O
we O
have O
discussed O
. O

Attackers O
are O
taking O
the O
time O
and O
effort O
to O
steal O
certificates O
because O
it O
is O
becoming O
necessary O
to O
gain O
a O
foothold O
on O
a O
targeted O
computer O
. O

Attempts O
to O
sign O
malware O
with O
code-signing O
certificates O
have O
become O
more O
common O
as O
the O
Internet O
and O
security O
systems O
have O
moved O
towards O
a O
more O
trust O
and O
reputation O
oriented O
model O
. O

This O
means O
that O
untrusted O
software O
may O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
run O
unless O
it O
is O
signed O
. O

As O
we O
noted O
in O
our O
previous O
research O
on O
the O
Apple S-IDTY
threat O
landscape O
, O
some O
operating O
systems O
, O
such O
as O
Mac B-OS
OS I-OS
X E-OS
, O
are O
configured O

However O
, O
using O
valid O
code-signing O

Suckfly S-APT
paints O
a O
stark O
picture O
of O
where O
cyberattack O
groups O
and O
cybercriminals O
are O
focusing O
their O
attentions O
. O

Our O
investigation O
shines O
a O
light O
on O
an O
often O
unknown O
and O
seedier O
secret O
life O
of O
code-signing O
certificates O
, O
which O
is O
completely O
unknown O
to O
their O
owners O
. O

The O
implications O
of O
this O
study O
shows O
that O
certificate O
owners O
need O
to O
keep O
a O
careful O
eye O
on O
them O
to O
prevent O
them O
from O
falling O
into O
the O
wrong O
hands O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
give O
certificates O
the O
protection O
they O
need O
so O
they O
can't O
be O
used O
maliciously O
. O

The O
certificates O
are O
only O
as O
secure O
as O
the O
safeguards O
that O
organizations O
put O
around O
them O
. O

Once O
a O
certificate O
has O
been O
compromised O
, O
so O
has O
the O
reputation O
of O
the O
organization O
who O
signed O
it O
. O

An O
organization O
whose O
certificate O
has O
been O
stolen O
and O
used O
to O
sign O
malware O
will O
always O
be O
associated O
with O
that O
activity O
. O

Symantec S-SECTEAM
monitors O
for O
this O
type O
of O
activity O
to O
help O
prevent O
organizations O
from O
being O
tied O
to O
malicious O
actions O
undertaken O
with O
their O
stolen O
certificates O
. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
this O
investigation O
, O
we O
ensured O
that O
all O
certificates O
compromised O
by O
Suckfly S-APT
were O
revoked O
and O
the O
affected O
companies O
notified O
. O

Over O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
a O
number O
of O
advanced O
threats O
and O
cybercrime O
groups O
who O
have O
stolen O
code-signing O
certificates O
. O

In O
all O
of O
the O
cases O
involving O
an O
advanced O
threat O
, O
the O
certificates O
were O
used O
to O
disguise O
malware O
as O
a O
legitimate O

Indian O
organizations O
targeted O
in O
Suckfly S-APT
attacks O
. O

In O
March B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
Symantec S-SECTEAM
published O
a O
blog O
on O
Suckfly S-APT
, O
an O
advanced O
cyberespionage O
group O
that O
conducted O
attacks O
against O
a O
number O
of O
South O
Korean O
organizations O
to O
steal O
digital O
certificates O
. O

Since O
then O
we O
have O
identified O
a O
number O
of O
attacks O
over O
a O
two-year O
period O
, O
beginning O
in O
April B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
which O
we O
attribute O
to O
Suckfly S-APT
. O

The O
attacks O
targeted O
high-profile O
targets O
, O
including O
government O
and O
commercial O
organizations O
. O

These O
attacks O
occurred O
in O
several O
different O
countries O
, O
but O
our O
investigation O
revealed O
that O
the O
primary O
targets O
were O
individuals O
and O
organizations O
primarily O
located O
in O
India S-LOC
. O

While O
there O
have O
been O
several O
Suckfly S-APT
campaigns O
that O
infected O
organizations O
with O
the O
group O
’s O
custom O
malware O
Backdoor.Nidiran S-MAL
, O
the O
Indian O
targets O
show O
a O
greater O
amount O
of O
post-infection O
activity O
than O
targets O
in O
other O
regions O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
these O
attacks O
were O
part O
of O
a O
planned O
operation O
against O
specific O
targets O
in O
India S-LOC
. O

The O
first O
known O
Suckfly S-APT
campaign O
began O
in O
April B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
. O

During O
our O
investigation O
of O
the O
campaign O
, O
we O
identified O
a O
number O
of O
global O
targets O
across O
several O
industries O
who O
were O
attacked O
in O
2015 S-TIME
. O

Many O
of O
the O
targets O
we O
identified O
were O
well O
known O
commercial O
organizations O
located O
in O
India S-LOC
. O

These O
organizations O
included O
: O

One O
of O
India S-LOC
's O
largest O
financial O
organizations O
A O
large O
e-commerce O
company O
The O
e-commerce O
company O
's O
primary O
shipping O
vendor O
One O
of O
India S-LOC
's O
top O
five O
IT O
firms O
A O
United B-LOC
States E-LOC
healthcare O
provider O
's O
Indian O
business O
unit O
Two O
government O
organizations O
. O

Suckfly S-APT
spent O
more O
time O
attacking O
the O
government O
networks O
compared O
to O
all O
but O
one O
of O
the O
commercial O
targets O
. O

Additionally O
, O
one O
of O
the O
two O
government O
organizations O
had O
the O
highest O
infection O
rate O
of O
the O
Indian O
targets O
. O

Figure O
1 O
shows O
the O
infection O
rate O
for O
each O
of O
the O
targets O
. O

Indian O
government O
org O
#2 O
is O
responsible O
for O
implementing O
network O
software O
for O
different O
ministries O
and O
departments O
within O
India S-LOC
's O
central O
government O
. O

The O
high O
infection O
rate O
for O
this O
target O
is O
likely O
because O
of O
its O
access O
to O
technology O
and O
information O
related O
to O
other O
Indian O
government O
organizations O
. O

Suckfly S-APT
's O
attacks O
on O
government O
organizations O
that O
provide O
information O
technology O
services O
to O
other O
government O
branches O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
India S-LOC
. O

It O
has O
conducted O
attacks O
on O
similar O
organizations O
in O
Saudi B-LOC
Arabia E-LOC
, O
likely O
because O
of O
the O
access O
that O
those O
organizations O
have O
. O

Suckfly S-APT
's O
targets O
are O
displayed O
in O

by O
their O
industry O
, O
which O
provides O
a O
clearer O
view O
of O
the O
group O
’s O
operations O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
group O
's O
attacks O
are O
focused O
on O
government O
or O
technology O
related O
companies O
and O
organizations O
. O

One O
of O
the O
attacks O
we O
investigated O
provided O
detailed O
insight O
into O
how O
Suckfly S-APT
conducts O
its O
operations O
. O

In O
2015 S-TIME
, O
Suckfly S-APT
conducted O
a O
multistage O
attack O
between O
April B-TIME
22 E-TIME
and O
May B-TIME
4 E-TIME
against O
an O
e-commerce O
organization O
based O
in O
India S-LOC
. O

Similar O
to O
its O
other O
attacks O
, O
Suckfly S-APT
used O
the O
Nidiran S-MAL
back O
door O
along O
with O
a O
number O
of O
hacktools O
to O
infect O
the O
victim O
's O
internal O
hosts O
. O

The O
tools O
and O
malware O
used O
in O
this O
breach O
were O
also O
signed O
with O
stolen O
digital O
certificates O
. O

Suckfly S-APT
's O
first O
step O
was O
to O
identify O
a O
user O
to O
target O
so O
the O
attackers O
could O
attempt O
their O
initial O
breach O
into O
the O
e-commerce O
company O
's O
internal O
network O
. O

We O
don't O
have O
hard O
evidence O
of O
how O
Suckfly S-APT
obtained O
information O
on O
the O
targeted O
user O
, O
but O
we O
did O
find O
a O
large O
open-source O
presence O
on O
the O
initial O
target O
. O

The O
target O
's O
job O
function O
, O
corporate O
email S-TOOL
address O
, O
information O
on O
work O
related O
projects O
, O
and O
publicly O
accessible O
personal O
blog O
could O
all O
be O
freely O
found O
online O
. O

On O
April B-TIME
22 I-TIME
, I-TIME
2015 E-TIME
, O
Suckfly S-APT
exploited O
a O
vulnerability O
on O
the O
targeted O
employee O
's O
operating O
system O
( O
Windows S-OS
) O
that O
allowed O
the O
attackers O
to O
bypass O
the O
User B-TOOL
Account I-TOOL
Control E-TOOL
and O
install O
the O
Nidiran S-MAL
back O
door O
to O
provide O
access O
for O
their O
attack O
. O

While O
we O
know O
the O
attackers O
used O
a O
custom O
dropper O
to O
install O
the O
back O
door O
, O
we O
do O
not O
know O
the O
delivery O
vector O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
amount O
of O
open-source O
information O
available O
on O
the O
target O
, O
it O
is O
feasible O
that O
a O
spear-phishing S-ACT
email S-TOOL
may O
have O
been O
used O
. O

After O
the O
attackers O
successfully O
exploited O
the O
employee O
’s O
system O
, O
they O
gained O
access O
to O
the O
e-commerce O
company O
's O
internal O
network O
. O

We O
found O
evidence O
that O
Suckfly S-APT
used O
hacktools O
to O
move O
latterly O
and O
escalate O
privileges O
. O

To O
do O
this O
the O
attackers O
used O
a O
signed O
credential-dumping O
tool O
to O
obtain O
the O
victim O
's O
account O
credentials O
. O

With O
the O
account O
credentials O
, O
the O
attackers O
were O
able O
to O
access O
the O
victim O
's O
account O
and O
navigate O
the O
internal O
corporate O
network O
as O
though O
they O
were O
the O
employee O
. O

On O
April B-TIME
27 E-TIME
, O
the O
attackers O
scanned O
the O
corporate O
internal O
network O
for O
hosts O
with O
ports O
8080 O
, O
5900 O
, O
and O
40 O
open O
. O

Ports O
8080 O
and O
5900 O
are O
common O
ports O
used O
with O
legitimate O
protocols O
, O
but O
can O
be O
abused O
by O
attackers O
when O
they O
are O
not O
secured O
. O

It O
isn't O
clear O
why O
the O
attackers O
scanned O
for O
hosts O
with O
port O
40 O
open O
because O
there O
isn't O
a O
common O
protocol O
assigned O
to O
this O
port O
. O

Based O
on O
Suckfly S-APT
scanning O
for O
common O
ports O
, O
it O
’s O
clear O
that O
the O
group O
was O
looking O
to O
expand O
its O
foothold O
on O
the O
e-commerce O
company O
's O
internal O
network O
. O

The O
attackers O
’ O
final O
step O
was O
to O
exfiltrate O
data O
off O
the O
victim O
’s O
network O
and O
onto O
Suckfly S-APT
’s O
infrastructure O
. O

While O
we O
know O
that O
the O
attackers O
used O
the O
Nidiran S-MAL
back O
door O
to O
steal O
information O
about O
the O
compromised O
organization O
, O
we O
do O
not O
know O
if O
Suckfly S-APT
was O
successful O
in O
stealing O
other O
information O
. O

These O
steps O
were O
taken O
over O
a O
13-day O
period O
, O
but O
only O
on O
specific O
days O
. O

While O
tracking O
what O
days O
of O
the O
week O
Suckfly S-APT
used O
its O
hacktools O
, O
we O
discovered O
that O
the O
group O
was O
only O
active O
Monday S-TIME
through O
Friday S-TIME
. O

There O
was O
no O
activity O
from O
the O
group O
on O
weekends O
. O

We O
were O
able O
to O
determine O
this O
because O
the O
attackers O
’ O
hacktools O
are O
command O
line O
driven O
and O
can O
provide O
insight O
into O
when O
the O
operators O
are O
behind O
keyboards O
actively O
working O
. O

Figure O
4 O
shows O
the O
attackers O
’ O
activity O
levels O
throughout O
the O
week O
. O

Suckfly S-APT
made O
its O
malware O
difficult O
to O
analyze O
to O
prevent O
their O
operations O
from O
being O
detected O
. O

However O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
successfully O
analyze O
Suckfly S-APT
malware O
samples O
and O
extract O
some O
of O
the O
communications O
between O
the O
Nidiran S-MAL
back O
door O
and O
the O
Suckfly S-APT
command B-TOOL
and I-TOOL
control E-TOOL
( O
C&C S-TOOL
) O
domains O
. O

We O
analyzed O
the O
dropper S-TOOL
, O
which O
is O
an O
executable O
that O
contains O
the O
following O
three O
files O
: O

dllhost.exe S-FILE
: O
The O
main O
host O
for O
the O
.dll S-FILE

Used O
to O
load O
encrypted O
payloads O
and O
then O
decrypt O
them O
. O
msfled O
: O
The O
encrypted O
payload O
. O

All O
three O
files O
are O
required O
for O
the O
malware O
to O
run O
correctly O
. O

Once O
the O
malware O
has O
been O
executed O
, O
it O
checks O
to O
see O
if O
it O
has O
a O
connection O
to O
the O
internet O
before O
running O
. O

If O
the O
connection O
test O
is O
successful O
, O
the O
malware O
runs O
and O
attempts O
to O
communicate O
with O
the O
C&C S-TOOL
domain O
over O
ports O
443 O
and O
8443 O
. O

In O
the O
samples O
we O
analyzed O
we O
found O
the O
port O
and O
C&C S-TOOL
information O
encrypted O
and O
hardcoded O
into O
the O
Nidiran S-MAL
malware O
itself O
. O

The O
key O
for O
the O
RC4 S-ENCR

in O
this O
sample O
is O
the O
hardcoded O
string O
“ O

. O

Once O
the O

All O
of O
these O

in O
India S-LOC

economy O
. O

By O
targeting O
all O
of O
these O

and O
conduct O
targeted O

for O
years O

and O
PinchDuke S-MAL
, O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
primarily O
collects O
information O
on O
the O
victim O
computer O

As O
is O
common O
for O
malware O
, O
the O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
infostealer S-TOOL
uses O
a O
mutex O
to O
ensure O
that O
only O
one O
instance O
of O
itself O
is O
running O
at O
a O
time O
. O

What O
is O
less O
common O
is O
that O
the O
name O
used O
for O
the O
mutex O
is O
often O
a O
timestamp O
. O

We O
believe O
these O
timestamps O
to O
be O
generated O
during O
the O
compilation O
of O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
from O
the O
local O
time O
of O
the O
computer O
being O
used O
. O

Comparing O
the O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
compilation O
timestamps O
, O
which O
always O
reference O
the O
time O
in O
the O
UTC+0 O
timezone O
, O
with O
the O
local O
time O
timestamps O
used O
as O
mutex O
names O
, O
and O
adjusting O
for O
the O
presumed O
timezone O
difference O
, O
we O
note O
that O
all O
of O
the O
mutex O
names O
reference O
a O
time O
and O
date O
that O
is O
within O
seconds O
of O
the O
respective O
sample O
’s O
compilation O
timestamp O
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
apparent O
timezone O
of O
the O
timestamps O
in O
all O
of O
the O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
samples O
compiled O
during O
the O
winter O
is O
UTC+3 O
, O
while O
for O
samples O
compiled O
during O
the O
summer O
, O
it O
is O
UTC+4 O
. O

The O
observed O
timezones O
correspond O
to O
the O
pre-2011 O
definition O
of O
Moscow S-LOC
Standard O
Time O
( O
MSK O
) O
, O
which O
was O
UTC+3 O
during O
the O
winter O
and O
UTC+4 O
during O
the O
summer O
. O

In O
2011 S-TIME
MSK O
stopped O
following O
Daylight O
Saving O
Time O
( O
DST O
) O
and O
was O
set O
to O
UTC+4 O
year-round O
, O
then O
reset O
to O
UTC O
+3 O
yearround O
in O
2014 S-TIME
. O

Some O
of O
the O
observed O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
samples O
that O
used O
timestamps O
as O
mutex O
names O
were O
compiled O
while O
MSK O
still O
respected O
DST O
and O
for O
these O
samples O
, O
the O
timestamps O
perfectly O
align O
with O
MSK O
as O
it O
was O
defined O
at O
the O
time O
. O

However O
, O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
samples O
compiled O
after O
MSK O
was O
altered O
still O
vary O
the O
timezone O
between O
UTC+3 O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
UTC+4 O
during O
the O
summer O
. O

While O
computers O
using O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Windows S-OS
automatically O
adjust O
for O
DST O
, O
changes O
in O
timezone O
definitions O
require O
that O
an O
update O
to O
Windows S-OS
be O
installed O
. O

We O
therefore O
believe O
that O
the O
Dukes S-APT
group O
simply O
failed O
to O
update O
the O
computer O
they O
were O
using O
to O
compile O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
samples O
, O
so O
that O
the O
timestamps O
seen O
in O
later O
samples O
still O
appear O
to O
follow O
the O
old O
definition O
of O
Moscow S-LOC
Standard O
Time O
. O

The O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
infostealer O
has O
occasionally O
been O
wrapped O
with O
a O
loader O
that O
appears O
to O
be O
unique O
to O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
and O
has O
never O
been O
observed O
being O
used O
with O
any O
of O
the O
other O
Duke S-APT
toolsets O
. O

GeminiDuke S-MAL
also O
occasionally O
embeds O
additional O
executables O
that O
attempt O
to O
achieve O
persistence O
on O
the O
victim O
computer O
. O

These O
persistence O
components O
appear O
to O
be O
uniquely O
customized O
for O
use O
with O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
, O
but O
they O
use O
many O
of O
the O

techniques O
as O
CosmicDuke S-MAL

While O
we O
believe O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
to O
be O
an O
entirely O
custom- O
written O
toolset O
with O
no O
direct O
sharing O
of O
code O
with O
other O
Duke S-APT
toolsets O
, O
the O
high-level O
ways O
in O
which O
many O
of O
its O
features O
have O
been O
implemented O
appear O
to O
be O
shared O
with O
other O
members O
of O
the O
Duke S-APT
arsenal O
. O

Specifically O
, O
the O
techniques O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
uses O
to O
extract O
user O
credentials O
from O
targeted O
software O
and O
to O
detect O
the O
presence O
of O
analysis O
tools O
appear O
to O
be O
based O
on O
the O
techniques O
used O
by O
PinchDuke S-MAL
. O

Likewise O
, O
many O
of O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
’s O
persistence O
components O
use O
techniques O
also O
used O
by O
components O
associated O
with O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
and O
CozyDuke S-MAL
. O

In O
all O
of O
these O
cases O
, O
the O
techniques O
are O
the O
same O
, O
but O
the O
code O
itself O
has O
been O
altered O
to O
work O
with O
the O
toolset O
in O
question O
, O
leading O
to O
small O
differences O
in O
the O
final O
implementation O
. O

A O
few O
of O
the O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
samples O
we O
discovered O
also O
included O
components O
that O
attempt O
to O
exploit O
either O
of O
the O
publicly O
known O
CVE-2010-0232 S-VULID
or O
CVE-2010- B-VULID
4398 E-VULID
privilege O
escalation O
vulnerabilities O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
CVE-2010-0232 S-VULID
, O
the O
exploit O
appears O
to O
be O
based O
directly O
on O
the O
proof O
of O
concept O
code O
published O
by O
security O
researcher O
Tavis O
Ormandy O
when O
he O
disclosed O
the O
vulnerability O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
exploit O
for O
CVE- B-VULID
2010-4398 E-VULID
was O
also O
based O
on O
a O
publicly O
available O
proof O
of O
concept O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
often O
embedding O
persistence O
or O
privilege O
escalation O
components O
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
has O
occasionally O
embedded O
PinchDuke S-MAL
, O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
, O
or O
MiniDuke S-MAL
components O
. O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
does O
not O
interoperate O
with O
the O
second O
, O
embedded O
malware O
in O
any O
way O
other O
than O
by O
writing O
the O
malware O
to O
disk O
and O
executing O
it O
. O

After O
that O
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
and O
the O
second O
malware O
operate O
entirely O
independently O
of O
each O
other O
, O
including O
separately O
contacting O
their O
C&C S-TOOL
servers O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
both O
malware O
have O
used O
the O
same O
C&C S-TOOL
server O
, O
but O
in O
other O
cases O
, O
even O
the O
servers O
have O
been O
different O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
while O
most O
of O
the O
compilation O
timestamps O
for O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
samples O
appear O
to O
be O
authentic O
, O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
a O
few O
cases O
of O
them O
being O
forged O
. O

One O
such O
case O
was O
detailed O
on O
page O
10 O
as O
an O
apparent O
evasion O
attempt O
. O

Another O
is O
a O
loader S-TOOL
variant O
seen O
during O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2010 E-TIME
in O
conjunction O
with O
both O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
and O
PinchDuke S-MAL
. O

These O
loader S-TOOL
samples O
all O
had O
compilation O
timestamps O
purporting O
to O
be O
from O
the O
24th B-TIME
or I-TIME
the I-TIME
25th I-TIME
of I-TIME
September I-TIME
, I-TIME
2001 E-TIME
. O

However O
, O
many O
of O
these O
loader O
samples O
embed O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
variants O
that O
exploit O
the O
CVE-2010- B-VULID
0232 E-VULID
privilege O
escalation O
vulnerability O
thus O
making O
it O
impossible O
for O
the O
compilation O
timestamps O
to O

Two O
details O
about O

worth O
noting O
. O

Firstly O
, O
some O
of O
the O
MiniDuke S-MAL

were O
written O
in O

‘ O
of O

, O
it O
has O
since O

. O

Secondly O
, O
some O
of O
the O
MiniDuke S-MAL
components O
do O
not O
contain O
a O

first O
caught O
our O
attention O
because O
it O
was O
being O
spread O
via O
a O
malicious O
Tor S-TOOL

The O

modify O
those O

by O
adding O

Once O
the O

it O
, O
the O

infect O
the O

Again O
, O
if O

they O
would O
get O

a O

that O

This O
, O
together O
with O
HammerDuke S-MAL

suggests O
that O
it O

HammerDuke S-MAL
is O
however O
interesting O
because O
it O
is O

even O
more O
so O
because O
of O
its O
occasional O
use O

Some O

the O

THE O
DUKES S-APT
7 O
YEARS O

CYBER O
ESPIONAGE O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
primarily O
use O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
when O
attempting O
to O
infect O
victims O
with O
their O
malware O
. O

These O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
range O
from O
ones O
purposely O
designed O
to O
look O
like O
spam O
messages O
used O
to O
spread O
common O
crimeware O
and O
addressed O
to O
large O
numbers O
of O
people O
, O
to O
highly O
targeted O
emails S-TOOL
addressed O
to O
only O
a O
few O
recipients O
( O
or O
even O
just O
one O
person O
) O
and O
with O
content O
that O
is O
highly O
relevant O
for O
the O
intended O
recipient O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
appear O
to O
have O
used O
previously O
compromised O
victims O
to O
send O
new O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
to O
other O
targets O
. O

The O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
used O
by O
the O
Dukes S-APT
may O
contain O
either O
specially-crafted O
malicious O
attachments O
or O
links O
to O
URLs O
hosting O
the O
malware O
. O

When O
malicious O
attachments O
are O
used O
, O
they O
may O
either O
be O
designed O
to O
exploit O
a O
vulnerability O
in O
a O
popular O
software O
assumed O
to O
be O
installed O
on O
the O
victim O
’s O
machine O
, O
such O
as O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Word S-TOOL
or O
Adobe B-TOOL
Reader E-TOOL
, O
or O
the O
attachment O
itself O
may O
have O
its O
icon O
and O
filename O
obfuscated O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
the O
file O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
an O
executable O
. O

The O
only O
instances O
which O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
where O
the O
Dukes S-APT
did O
not O
use O
spear-phishing S-ACT
as O
the O
initial O
infection O
vector O
is O
with O
certain O
OnionDuke S-MAL
variants O
. O

These O
were O
instead O
spread O
using O
either O
a O
malicious O
Tor S-TOOL
node O
that O
would O
trojanize O
legitimate O
applications O
on-the-fly O
with O
the O
OnionDuke S-MAL
toolset O
, O
or O
via O
torrent O
files O
containing O
previously O
trojanized O
versions O
of O
legitimate O
applications O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
the O
Dukes S-APT
are O
known O
to O
sometimes O
re-infect O
a O
victim O
of O
one O
of O
their O
malware O
tools O
with O
another O
one O
of O
their O
tools O
. O

Examples O
include O
CozyDuke S-MAL
infecting O
its O
victims O
with O
SeaDuke S-MAL
, O
HammerDuke S-MAL
,or O
OnionDuke S-MAL
; O
and O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
infecting O
its O
victims O
with O
PinchDuke S-MAL
,GeminiDuke S-MAL
or O
MiniDuke S-MAL
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
have O
employed O
exploits O
both O
in O
their O
infection O
vectors O
as O
well O
as O
in O
their O
malware O
. O

We O
are O
however O
only O
aware O
of O
one O
instance O
- O
the O
exploitation O
of O
CVE-2013-0640 S-VULID
to O
deploy O
MiniDuke S-MAL
- O
where O
we O
believe O
the O
exploited O
vulnerability O
was O
a O
zero-day S-VULNAME
at O
the O
time O
that O
the O
group O
acquired O
the O
exploit O
. O

In O
all O
known O
cases O
where O
exploits O
were O
employed O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
Dukes S-APT
did O
not O
themselves O
discover O
the O
vulnerabilities O
or O
design O
the O
original O
exploits O
; O
for O
the O
exploited O
zero-day S-VULNAME
, O
we O
believe O
the O
Dukes S-APT
purchased O
the O
exploit O
. O

In O
all O
other O
cases O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
group O
simply O
repurposed O
publicly O
available O
exploits O
or O
proofs O
of O
concept O
. O

Attribution O
is O
always O
a O
difficult O
question O
, O
but O
attempting O
to O
answer O
it O
is O
important O
in O
understanding O
these O
types O
of O
threats O
and O
how O
to O
defend O
against O
them O
. O

This O
paper O
has O
already O
stated O
that O
we O
believe O
the O
Dukes S-APT
to O
be O
a O
Russian O
state-sponsored O
cyberespionage B-ACT
operation E-ACT
. O

To O
reach O
this O
conclusion O
, O
we O
began O
by O
analyzing O
the O
apparent O
objectives O
and O
motivations O
of O
the O
group O
. O

Based O
on O
what O
we O
currently O
know O
about O
the O
targets O
chosen O
by O
the O
Dukes S-APT
over O
the O
past O
7 O
years O
, O
they O
appear O
to O
have O
consistently O
targeted O
entities O
that O
deal O
with O
foreign O
policy O
and O
security O
policy O
matters O
. O

These O
targets O
have O
included O
organizations O
such O
as O
ministries O
of O
foreign O
affairs O
, O
embassies O
, O
senates O
, O
parliaments O
, O
ministries O
of O
defense O
, O
defense O
contractors O
, O
and O
think O
tanks O
. O

In O
one O
of O
their O
more O
intriguing O
cases O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
have O
appeared O
to O
also O
target O
entities O
involved O
in O
the O
trafficking O
of O
illegal O
drugs O
. O

Even O
such O
targets O
however O
appear O
to O
be O
consistent O
with O
the O
overarching O
theme O
, O
given O
the O
drug O
trade O
’s O
relevance O
to O
security O
policy O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
, O
we O
are O
confident O
in O
our O
conclusion O
that O
the O
Dukes S-APT
’ O
primary O
mission O
is O
the O
collection O
of O
intelligence O
to O
support O
foreign O
and O
security O
policy O
decision-making O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
length O
of O
the O
Dukes S-APT
’ O
activity O
, O
our O
estimate O
of O
the O
amount O
of O
resources O
invested O
in O
the O
operation O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
their O
activity O
only O
appears O
to O
be O
increasing O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
group O
to O
have O
significant O
and O
most O
critically O
, O
stable O
financial O
backing O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
have O
consistently O
operated O
large-scale O
campaigns O
against O
high-profile O
targets O
while O
concurrently O
engaging O
in O
smaller O
, O
more O
targeted O
campaigns O
with O
apparent O
coordination O
and O
no O
evidence O
of O
unintentional O
overlap O
or O
operational O
clashes O
. O

We O
therefore O
believe O
the O
Dukes S-APT
to O
be O
a O
single O
, O
large O
, O
wellcoordinated O
organization O
with O
clear O
separation O
of O
responsibilities O
and O
targets O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
appear O
to O
prioritize O
the O
continuation O
of O
their O
operations O
over O
stealth O
. O

Their O
2015 O
CozyDuke S-MAL
and O
CloudDuke S-MAL
campaigns O
take O
this O
to O
the O
extreme O
by O
apparently O
opting O
for O
speed O
and O
quantity O
over O
stealth O
and O
quality O
. O

In O
the O
most O
extreme O
case O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
continued O
with O
their O
July B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
CloudDuke S-MAL
campaign O
even O
after O
their O
activity O
had O
been O
outed O
by O
multiple O
security O
vendors O
. O

We O
therefore O
believe O
the O
Dukes S-APT
’ O
primary O
mission O
to O
be O
so O
valuable O
to O
their O
benefactors O
that O
its O
continuation O
outweighs O
everything O
else O
. O

This O
apparent O
disregard O
for O
publicity O
suggests O
, O
in O
our O
opinion O
, O
that O
the O
benefactors O
of O
the O
Dukes S-APT
is O
so O
powerful O
and O
so O
tightly O
connected O

the O

that O
the O
Dukes S-APT
are O
able O
to O
operate O
with O
no O
apparent O
fear O
of O

on O

caught O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
only O
benefactor O
with O
the O
power O
to O
offer O
such O
comprehensive O
protection O
would O
be O
the O
government O
of O
the O

the O

. O

We O
therefore O
believe O
the O
Dukes S-APT
to O
work O
either O
within O
or O
directly O
for O
a O
government O
, O
thus O
ruling O
out O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O

As O
we O
saw O
in O
both O
2016 S-TIME

2017 S-TIME
, O
disruptions O
to O
Necurs S-MAL
went O
hand-in-hand O
with O
quiet O
periods O
from O
TA505 S-APT
. O

When O
the O

came O
back O
online O
, O
TA505 S-APT
campaigns O
quickly O
returned O
, O
usually O
at O
even O
greater O
scale O
than O
before O
the O

. O

The O
following O

a O
more O
detailed O
description O
of O
the O
malware O
and O
notable O
campaign O
attributes O
associated O
with O
TA505 S-APT
. O

The O
now O
infamous O
Dridex S-MAL
banking O
Trojan S-MAL
can O
trace O
much O
of O
its O
DNA O
to O
Cridex S-MAL
and O
Bugat S-MAL
. O

Dridex S-MAL
itself O
appeared O
shortly O
after O
the O
Zeus S-MAL
banking O
Trojan S-MAL
was O
taken O
down O
. O

It O
was O
originally O
documented O
on O
July B-TIME

, I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
( O
or O
June B-TIME
22 I-TIME
, I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
according O
to O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
) O
and O
the O
first O
campaign O
we O
observed O
in O
which O
TA505 S-APT
distributed O
Dridex S-MAL
occurred O
three O
days O
later O
on O
July B-TIME
28 E-TIME
. O

Although O
a O
number O
of O
actors O
have O
distributed O
Dridex S-MAL
, O
TA505 S-APT
operates O
multiple O
affiliate O
IDs O
, O
including O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
earliest O
recorded O
affiliate O
, O
botnet O
ID O
125 O
. O

These O
early O
campaigns O
were O
distributed O
via O
the O
Lerspeng S-MAL
downloader S-TOOL
while O
later O
campaigns O
occasionally O
used O
Pony S-MAL
or O
Andromeda S-MAL
as O
intermediate O
loaders O
to O
distribute O
various O
instances O
of O
Dridex S-MAL
. O

Although O
TA505 S-APT
initially O
distributed O
Dridex S-MAL
botnet O
ID O
125 O
, O
they O
were O
observed O
using O

. O

Later O
, O
they O
were O
also O
associated O
with O
botnet O
IDs O
7200 O
and O

These O

TA505 S-APT
continued O
distributing O
Dridex S-MAL
through O
early B-TIME
June I-TIME
2017 E-TIME
using O
a O
range O
of O
email S-TOOL
attachments O
. O

Most O
recently O
these O

bearing O
malicious O
macros S-TOOL
that O
call O

that O

However O
, O
because O
of O
the O
length O
of O

for O
which O
the O

has O
been O
distributing O

to O
a O

. O

In O
October B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
, O
we O
observed O
several O
campaigns O
in O
which O
TA505 S-APT
targeted O
Japanese O
and O
UK S-LOC
organizations O
with O
the O
Shifu S-MAL
banking O
Trojan S-MAL
. O

Shifu S-MAL
is O
relatively O
common O
in O
Japan S-LOC
but O
was O
a O
new O
addition O
to O
TA505 S-APT
’s O
toolbox O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
they O
introduced O
Shifu S-MAL
after O
high-profile O
law O
enforcement O
actions O
impacted O
Dridex S-MAL
distribution O
. O

However O
, O
TA505 S-APT
was O
also O
among O
the O
first O
actors O
to O
return O
to O
high-volume O
Dridex S-MAL
distribution O
this O
same O
month O
, O
even O
as O
they O
demonstrated O
their O
ability O
to O
diversify O
and O
deliver O
threats O
beyond O
Dridex S-MAL
. O

As O
with O
many O
of O
their O
other O
campaigns O
, O
TA505 S-APT
delivered O
Shifu S-MAL
through O
macro S-TOOL
laden O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Office S-TOOL
document O

. O

TA505 S-APT
introduced O
Locky S-MAL
ransomware O
in O
February B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
. O

After O
alternating O
for O
over O
four O
months O
with O
Dridex S-MAL
, O
Locky S-MAL
became O
the O
payload O
of O
choice O
for O
TA505 S-APT
, O
eclipsing O
earlier O
campaigns O
in O
terms O
of O
volume O
and O
reach O
. O

TA505 S-APT
stopped O
distributing O
Dridex S-MAL
in O
July B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
relying O
almost O
exclusively O
on O
Locky S-MAL
through O
December B-TIME
of I-TIME
that I-TIME
year E-TIME
. O

Like O
Dridex S-MAL
, O
Locky S-MAL
is O
also O
distributed O
in O
an O

TA505 S-APT

Low-volume O

Dridex S-MAL
appeared O
from O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME
2015 I-TIME

February I-TIME
2016 E-TIME
; O
it O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
these O
“ O
moderate O

” O
campaigns O
were O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
the O
largest O

Alternating O
Dridex S-MAL
and O
Locky S-MAL

A O
lull O
in O
June B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
associated O
with O
a O
disruption O
in O
the O
Necurs S-MAL
botnet O
; O
TA505 S-APT
is O
heavily O
reliant O
on O
this O
massive O
botnet O
to O
send O
out O
high-volume O
malicious O

and O
disappearances O
of O
TA505 S-APT

frequently O
accompany O
disruptions O
in O
Necurs S-MAL

Extremely O
high-volume O

Locky S-MAL
exclusively O
in O
July B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
consistently O
delivering O
tens O
of O
millions O
of O

. O

Another O
lull O
in O
November B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
saw O
the O
complete O
absence O
of O
Locky S-MAL
and O
Dridex S-MAL
, O
while O
high-volume O
campaigns O
reappeared O
in O
December S-TIME
, O
albeit O
at O
lower O
volumes O
than O
during O
the O
Q3 O
2016 S-TIME
peak O
. O

An O
expected O
break O
following O
the O
2016-2017 B-TIME
winter E-TIME
holidays O
turned O
into O
an O
unexplained O
three-month O
hiatus O
for O
TA505 S-APT
. O

Large-scale O
Dridex S-MAL
and O
Locky S-MAL
campaigns O
returned O
in O
Q2 O
2017 S-TIME
, O
although O
none O
reached O
the O
volumes O
we O
observed O
in O
mid-2016 S-TIME
. O

Later O
campaigns O
saw O
new O
attachment O
types O
, O
even O
as O
Dridex S-MAL
and O
Locky S-MAL
payloads O
remained O
largely O
unchanged O
. O

Locky S-MAL
distribution O
ceased O
in O
June S-TIME
and O
July S-TIME
but O
returned O
in O
August S-TIME
with O
volumes O
rivaling O
the O
peaks O
of O
2016 S-TIME
. O

TA505 S-APT
turned O
to O
URLs O
in O
early O
August B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
to O
distribute O
Locky S-MAL
, O
finally O
eschewing O
the O
document O
or O
zipped S-TOOL
script O
attachments O
that O
have O
characterized O
the O
majority O
of O
their O
Locky S-MAL
campaigns O
since O
February B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
; O
most O
of O
these O
URLs O
linked O
to O
malicious O
documents O
and O
scripts O
. O

By O
later O
August S-TIME
, O
TA505 S-APT
had O
turned O
back O
to O
large O
attachment O
campaigns O
, O
primarily O
distributing O
various O
zipped S-TOOL
scripts O
that O
downloaded O
Locky S-MAL
. O

The O
group O
continued O
this O
pattern O
with O
occasional O
URL O
campaigns O
and O
attached O
HTML S-TOOL
files O
bearing O
malicious O
links O
. O

TA505 S-APT
first O
introduced O
Rockloader S-MAL
in O
April B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
as O
an O
intermediate O
loader S-TOOL
for O
Locky S-MAL
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
Rockloader S-MAL
was O
the O
initial O
payload O
downloaded O
by O
malicious O
attached O
JavaScript S-TOOL

. O

Once O
Rockloader S-MAL
was O
installed O
, O
it O
downloaded O
Locky S-MAL
and O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
Pony S-MAL
and O
Kegotip S-MAL
. O

Pony S-MAL
is O
another O

Kegotip S-MAL
is O
an O

that O
would O
appear O
in O
a O
small O
number O

the O
following O

as O
the O
primary O
payload O
. O

Bart S-MAL

appeared O
for O
exactly O
one O
day O
on O
June B-TIME
24 I-TIME

2016 E-TIME
. O

It O
was O
a O
secondary O

, O
the O
initial O
payload O
in O
a O
large O
email S-TOOL
campaign O
using O
zipped S-TOOL
JavaScript S-TOOL

. O

The O
Bart S-MAL
ransom O
screen O
was O
visually O
similar O
to O
Locky S-MAL
’s O
but O
Bart S-MAL
had O
one O
important O
distinction O
: O
it O
could O
encrypt O
files O
without O
contacting O
a O
command O
and O
control O
server O
. O

However O
, O
we O
have O
not O
seen O
Bart S-MAL
since O
, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
was O
either O
an O
experiment O
or O
that O
the O
ransomware O
did O
not O
function O
as O
expected O
for O
TA505 S-APT
. O

TA505 S-APT
briefly O
distributed O
the O
Kegotip S-MAL
information B-TOOL
stealer E-TOOL
in O
April B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
. O

Across O
two O

It O
also O

TA505 S-APT
introduced O
Jaff S-MAL

Jaff S-MAL
was O
not O

was O
initially O
similar O
to O
the O

It O
was O
primarily O
notable O
for O
its O
high-volume O

its O

The O
Trick S-MAL
, O
also O
known O
as O
Trickbot S-MAL
, O
is O
another O
banking O
Trojan S-MAL
that O
TA505 S-APT
first O
began O
distributing O
in O
June B-TIME
of I-TIME
2017 E-TIME
, O
although O
we O
have O
observed O
The O
Trick S-MAL
in O
the O
wild O
since O
fall B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
usually O
in O
regionally O
targeted O
campaigns O
. O

It O
is O
generally O
considered O
a O
descendant O
of O
the O
Dyreza S-MAL
banking O
Trojan S-MAL
and O
features O
mutliple O
modules O
. O

The O
main O
bot O
is O
responsible O
for O
persistence O
, O
the O
downloading O
of O
additional O
modules O
, O
loading O
affiliate O
payloads O
, O
and O
loading O
updates O
for O
the O
malware O
. O

As O
with O
much O
of O
the O
malware O
distributed O
by O
TA505 S-APT
, O
The O
Trick S-MAL
has O
appeared O
in O
frequent O
, O
high-volume O
campaigns O
. O

The O
campaigns O
used O
a O
mix O
of O
attached O
zipped S-TOOL
scripts O
( O
WSF S-TOOL
, O
VBS S-TOOL
) O
, O

. O

The O
last O
TA505 S-APT
campaigns O
featuring O
The O
Trick S-MAL
appeared O
in O
mid-September B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
with O
payloads O
alternating O
between O
Locky S-MAL
and O
The O
Trick S-MAL
. O

Philadelphia S-MAL
ransomware O
has O
been O
circulating O
since O
September B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
. O

It O
first O
attracted O
our O
attention O
in O
April B-TIME
of I-TIME
this I-TIME
year E-TIME
when O
we O
observed O
an O
actor O
customizing O
the O
malware O
for O
use O
in O
highly O
targeted O
campaigns O
. O

In O
a O
brief O
stint O
, O
TA505 S-APT
distributed O
it O
in O
one O
large O
campaign O
in O
July S-TIME
, O
but O
we O
have O
not O
seen O
them O
use O
it O
since O
. O

GlobeImposter S-MAL
is O
another O
ransomware O
strain O
that O
saw O
relatively O
small-scale O
distribution O
until O
TA505 S-APT
began O
including O
it O
in O
malicious O
spam O
campaigns O
at O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME
July I-TIME
2017 E-TIME
. O

TA505 S-APT
primarily O
distributed O
GlobeImposter S-MAL
in O
zipped S-TOOL
script O
attachments O
through O
the O
beginning O
of O
September B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
. O

Again O
, O
GlobeImposter S-MAL
is O
not O
particularly O
innovative O
but O
TA505 S-APT
elevated O
the O
ransomware O
from O
a O
regional O
variant O
to O
a O
major O
landscape O
feature O
during O
roughly O
six O
weeks O
of O
large O
campaigns O
. O

TA505 S-APT
is O
arguably O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
financially O
motivated O
threat O
actors O
because O
of O
the O
extraordinary O
volumes O
of O
messages O
they O
send O
. O

The O
variety O
of O
malware O
delivered O
by O
the O
group O
also O
demonstrates O
their O
deep O
connections O
to O
the O
underground O
malware O
scene O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
writing O
, O
Locky S-MAL
ransomware O
remains O
their O
malware O
of O
choice O
, O
even O
as O
the O
group O
continues O
to O
experiment O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
additional O
malware O
. O

The O
history O
of O
TA505 S-APT
is O
instructive O
because O
they: O
Have O
proven O
to O
be O
highly O
adaptable O
, O
shifting O
techniques O
and O
malware O
frequently O
to O
“ O
follow O
the O
money O
” O
, O
while O
largely O
sticking O
to O
successful O
strategies O
where O
possible O
Are O
flexible O
, O
using O
largely O
interchangeable O
components O
, O
innovating O
where O
necessary O
on O
the O
malware O
front O
and O
using O
off-the-shelf O
malware O
where O
possible O
Operate O
at O
massive O
scale O
, O
consistently O
driving O
global O
trends O
in O
malware O
distribution O
and O
message O
volume O
. O

Each O
of O
these O
elements O
makes O
TA505 S-APT
a O
magnifying O
lens O
through O
which O
to O
consider O
the O
framework O
employed O
by O
many O
modern O
threat O
actors O
. O

Such O
a O
framework O
typically O
consists O
of O
five O
elements O
: O

Actor O
: O
The O
attacker O
organization O
; O
real O
humans O
driven O
by O
various O
motivations O
-- O
In O
the O
case O
of O
TA505 S-APT
, O
the O
motivations O
are O
financial O
. O

Vector O
: O
The O
delivery O
mechanism O
; O
email S-TOOL
via O
attacker-controlled O
or O
leased O
spam O
botnet O
-- O
Necurs S-MAL
for O
TA505 S-APT
-- O
remains O
a O
dominant O
vector O
, O
and O
certainly O
the O
vector O
of O
choice O
for O
this O
actor O
. O

Hoster O
: O
The O
sites O
hosting O
malware O
; O
if O
malware O
is O
not O
directly O
attached O
to O
email S-TOOL
, O
then O
macro S-TOOL
enabled O
documents O
, O
malicious O
scripts O
, O
or O
exploit O
kits O
will O
pull O
payloads O
from O
these O
servers O
. O

TA505 S-APT
almost O
exclusively O
hosts O
malware O
in O
this O
way O
, O
although O
they O
vary O
the O
means O
of O
installing O
their O
final O
payloads O
on O
victim O
machines O
. O

Payload O
: O
The O
malware O
; O
software O
that O
will O
enable O
the O
attacker O
to O
make O
use O
of O
( O
control O
, O
exfiltrate O
data O
from O
, O
or O
download O
more O
software O
to O
) O
the O
target O
computer O
. O

For O
TA505 S-APT
, O
the O
payloads O
have O
shifted O
over O
the O
years O
and O
months O
of O
their O
activity O
, O
but O
their O
sending O
and O
hosting O
infrastructure O
make O
these O
changes O
relatively O
simple O
to O
implement O
. O

C&C S-TOOL
: O
The O
command B-TOOL
and I-TOOL
control E-TOOL
channel O
that O
serves O
to O
relay O
commands O
between O
the O
installed O
malware O
and O
attackers O
. O

TA505 S-APT
operates O
a O
variety O
of O
C&C S-TOOL
servers O
, O
allowing O
it O
to O
be O
resilient O
in O
the O
case O
of O
takedowns O
, O
sinkholes O
, O
and O
other O
defensive O
operations O
. O

This O
framework O
enables O
attackers O
to O
operate O
in O
robust O
, O
horizontally O
segmented O
ecosystems O
, O
specializing O
in O
developing O
certain O
parts O
of O
the O
framework O
, O
and O
selling O
or O
leasing O
to O
others O
; O
such O
frameworks O
are O
resistant O
to O
takedowns O
and O
individual O
component O
failures O
. O

But O
such O
frameworks O
also O
increase O
attackers' O
detection O
surface O
, O
that O
is O
, O
their O
susceptibility O
to O
discovery O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
TA505 S-APT
, O
while O
most O
elements O
of O
the O
framework O
are O
well-developed O
, O
their O
reliance O
on O
the O
Necurs S-MAL
botnet O
for O
the O
sending O
high-volume O
malicious O
spam O
- O
a O
key O
component O
of O
the O
Vector O
element O
above O
- O
appears O
to O
be O
their O
Achilles S-MAL
heel O
. O

Lewis O

FireEye S-SECTEAM
recently O
published O
a O
blog O
covering O
the O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
, O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
for O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
when O
preparing O
to O
deploy O
the O
TRITON S-MAL/TRISIS S-MAL
malware O
framework O
in O
2017 S-TIME
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
post O
does O
a O
commendable O
job O
in O
making O
public O
findings O
previously O
only O
privately O
shared O
( O
presumably O
by O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
, O
and O
in O
several O
reports O
I O
authored O
for O
my O
employer O
, O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
) O
to O
threat O
intelligence O
customers O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
blog O
continues O
to O
push O
forward O
the O
narrative O
of O
how O
ICS B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
are O
enabled O
through O
prepositioning O
and O
initial O
intrusion O
operations O
– O
an O
item O
I O
have O
discussed O
at O
length O
. O

Yet O
one O
point O
of O
confusion O
in O
the O
blog O
comes O
at O
the O
very O
start O
: O
referring O
to O
the O
entity O
responsible O
for O
TRITON S-MAL
as O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
. O

This O
seems O
confusing O
as O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
earlier O
publicly O
declared O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
as O
a O
discrete O
entity O
, O
linked O
to O
a O
Russian O
research O
institution O
, O
and O
christened O
it O
as O
“ O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
” O
. O

In O
the O
2018 S-TIME
public O
posting O
announcing O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
researchers O
noted O
that O
the O
institute O
in O
question O
at O
least O
supported O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
activity O
in O
deploying O
TRITON S-MAL
, O
with O
subsequent O
public O
presentations O
at O
Cyberwarcon S-SECTEAM
and O
the O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Lab E-SECTEAM
sponsored O
Security B-SECTEAM
Analyst I-SECTEAM
Summit E-SECTEAM
essentially O
linking O
TRITON S-MAL
and O
the O
research O
institute O
( O
and O
therefore O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
) O
as O
one O
in O
the O
same O
. O

Yet O
the O
most-recent O
posting O
covering O
TTPs S-PROT
from O
initial O
access O
through O
prerequisites O
to O
enable O
final O
delivery O
of O
effects O
on O
target O
( O
deploying O
TRITON S-MAL/TRISIS S-MAL
) O
avoids O
the O
use O
of O
the O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
term O
entirely O
. O

In O
subsequent O
discussion O
, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
personnel O
indicate O
that O
there O
was O
not O
“ O
an O
avalanche O
of O
evidence O
to O
substantiate O
” O
anything O
more O
than O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
– O
summing O
matters O
by O
indicating O
this O
term O
“ O
is O
the O
best O
we O
’ve O
got O
for O
the O
public O
for O
now O
” O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
parallel O
work O
at O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
( O
my O
employer O
, O
where O
I O
have O
performed O
significant O
work O
on O
the O
activity O
described O
above O
) O
uncovered O
similar O
conclusions O
concerning O
TTPs S-PROT
and O
behaviors O
, O
for O
both O
the O
2017 S-TIME
event O
and O
subsequent O
activity O
in O
other O
industrial O
sectors O
. O

Utilizing O
Diamond O
Model O
methodology O
for O
characterizing O
activity O
by O
behaviors O
attached O
to O
victims O
, O
we O
began O
tracking O
TRITON S-MAL/TRISIS S-MAL
and O
immediate O
enabling O
activity O
as O
a O
distinct O
activity O
group O
( O
collection O
of O
behaviors O
, O
infrastructure O
, O
and O
victimology O
) O
designated O
XENOTIME S-APT
. O

Based O
on O
information O
gained O
from O
discussion O
with O
the O
initial O
TRITON S-MAL/TRISIS S-MAL
responders O
and O
subsequent O
work O
on O
follow-on O
activity O
by O
this O
entity O
, O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
developed O
a O
comprehensive O
( O
public O
) O
picture O
of O
adversary O
activity O
roughly O
matching O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
analysis O
published O
in O
April B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
, O
described O
in O
various O
media O
. O

At O
this O
stage O
, O
we O
have O
two O
similar O
, O
parallel O
constructions O
of O
events O
– O
the O
how O
behind O
the O
immediate O
deployment O
and O
execution O
of O
TRITON S-MAL/TRISIS S-MAL
– O
yet O
dramatically O
different O
responses O
in O
terms O
of O
attribution O
and O
labeling O
. O

Since O
late B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
, O
based O
upon O
the O
most-recent O
posting O
, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
appears O
to O
have O
“ O
walked O
back O
” O
the O
previously-used O
terminology O
of O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
and O
instead O
refers O
rather O
cryptically O
to O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
, O
while O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
leveraged O
identified O
behaviors O
to O
consistently O
refer O
to O
an O
activity O
group O
, O
XENOTIME S-APT
. O

Given O
that O
both O
organizations O
appear O
to O
describe O
similar O
( O
if O
not O
identical O
) O
activity O
, O
any O
reasonable O
person O
could O
( O
and O
should O
) O
ask O
– O
why O
the O
inconsistency O
in O
naming O
and O
identification? O
Aside O
from O
the O
competitive O
vendor O
naming O
landscape O
( O
which O
I O
am O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
in O
cases O
on O
direct O
overlap O
, O
but O
which O
has O
more O
to O
say O
for O
itself O
when O
different O
methodologies O
are O
employed O
around O
similar O
observations O
) O
, O
the O
distinction O
between O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
and O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
’ O
approaches O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
comes O
down O
to O
fundamental O
philosophical O
differences O
in O
methodology O
. O

As O
wonderfully O
described O
in O
a O
recent O
public O
posting O
, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
adheres O
to O
a O
naming O
convention O
based O
upon O
extensive O
data O
collection O
and O
activity O
comparison O
, O
designed O
to O
yield O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
discrete O
, O
identifiable O
entity O
responsible O
for O
a O
given O
collection O
of O
activity O
. O

This O
technique O
is O
precise O
and O
praiseworthy O
– O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
appears O
so O
rigorous O
as O
to O
impose O
limitations O
on O
the O
ability O
to O
dynamically O
adjust O
and O
adapt O
to O
emerging O
adversary O
activity O
. O
( O
Or O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
even O
categorize O
otherwise O
well-known O
historical O
actors O
operating O
to O
the O
present O
day O
, O
such O
as O
Turla S-APT
. O
) O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
methodology O
may O
have O
particular O
limitations O
in O
instances O
where O
adversaries O
( O
such O
as O
XENOTIME S-APT
and O
presumably O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
) O
rely O
upon O
extensive O
use O
of O
publicly-available O
, O
commonly-used O
tools O
with O
limited O
amounts O
of O
customization O
. O

In O
such O
cases O
, O
utilizing O
purely O
technical O
approaches O
for O
differentiation O
( O
an O
issue O
I O
lightly O
touched O
on O
in O
a O
recent O
post O
) O
becomes O
problematic O
, O
especially O
when O
trying O
to O
define O
attribution O
to O
specific O
, O
“ O
who-based O
” O
entities O
( O
such O
as O
a O
Russian O
research O
institute O
) O
. O

My O
understanding O
is O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
labels O
entities O
where O
definitive O
attribution O
is O
not O
yet O
possible O
with O
the O
“ O
TEMP O
” O
moniker O
( O
hence O
, O
TEMP.Veles S-APT
) O
– O
yet O
in O
this O
case O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
developed O
and O
deployed O
the O
label O
, O
then O
appeared O
to O
move O
away O
from O
it O
in O
subsequent O
reporting O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
public O
blog O
post O
– O
which O
also O
indicated O
that O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
is O
responding O
to O
an O
intrusion O
at O
a O
second O
facility O
featuring O
the O
same O
or O
similar O
observations O
– O
this O
is O
presumably O
not O
for O
lack O
of O
evidence O
, O
yet O
the O
“ O
downgrade O
” O
occurs O
all O
the O
same O
. O

In O
comparison O
, O
XENOTIME S-APT
was O
defined O
based O
on O
principles O
of O
infrastructure O
( O
compromised O
third-party O
infrastructure O
and O
various O
networks O
associated O
with O
several O
Russian O
research O
institutions O
) O
, O
capabilities O
( O
publicly- O
and O
commercially-available O
tools O
with O
varying O
levels O
of O
customization O
) O
and O
targeting O
( O
an O
issue O
not O
meant O
for O
discussion O
in O
this O
blog O
) O
. O

In O
personally O
responding O
to O
several O
incidents O
across O
multiple O
industry O
sectors O
since O
early B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
matching O
TTPs S-PROT
from O
the O
TRITON S-MAL/TRISIS S-MAL
event O
, O
these O
items O
proved O
consistent O
and O
supported O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
XENOTIME S-APT
activity O
group O
. O

This O
naming O
decision O
was O
founded O
upon O
the O
underlying O
methodology O
described O
in O
the O
Diamond O
Model O
of O
intrusion O
analysis O
. O

As O
such O
, O
this O
decision O
does O
not O
necessarily O
refer O
to O
a O

rather O
a O

this O

“ O

represent O

Ultimately O
, O
the O

these O

describe O

at O
the O

appear O
different O

This O
question O
of O
perception O
and O
accuracy O
rests O
upon O
the O
underlying O
epistemic O
framework O
and O
the O
goal O
conceived O
for O
that O
framework O
in O
defining O
an O
adversary O
: O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
methodology O
follows O
a O
deductive O
approach O
requiring O
the O
collection O
of O
significant O
evidence O
over O
time O
to O
yield O
a O
conclusion O
that O
will O
be O
necessary O
given O
the O
premises O
( O
the O
totality O
of O
evidence O
suggests O
APTxx O
) O
; O
the O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
approach O
instead O
seeks O
an O
inductive O
approach O
, O
where O
premises O
may O
all O
be O
true O
but O
the O
conclusion O
need O
not O
necessarily O
follow O
from O
them O
given O
changes O
in O

other O

, O

) O
. O

From O
an O
external O
analysts O
’ O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
wonder O
is O
, O
which O
is O
superior O
to O
the O
other? O
And O
my O
answer O
for O
this O
is O
: O
neither O
is O
perfect O
, O
but O
both O
are O
useful O
– O
depending O
upon O
your O
goals O
and O
objectives O
. O

But O
rather O
than O
trying O
to O
pursue O
some O
comparison O
between O
the O
two O
for O
identification O
of O
superiority O
( O
an O
approach O
that O
will O
result O
in O
unproductive O
argument O
and O
social O
media O
warring O
) O
, O
the O
point O
of O
this O
post O
is O
to O
highlight O
the O
distinctions O
between O
these O
approaches O
and O
how O
– O
in O
the O
case O
of O
“ O
the O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
– O
they O
result O
in O
noticeably O
different O
conclusions O
from O
similar O
datasets O
. O

One O
reason O
for O
the O
distinction O
may O
be O
differences O
in O
evidence O
, O
as O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
public O
reporting O
notes O
two O
distinct O
events O
of O
which O
they O
are O
aware O
of O
and O
have O
responded O
to O
related O
to O
“ O
the O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
” O
while O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
has O
been O
engaged O
several O
instances O
– O
thus O
, O
Dragos S-SECTEAM
would O
possess O
more O
evidence O
to O
cement O
the O
definition O
of O
an O
activity O
group O
, O
while O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
data O
collection-centric O
approach O
would O
require O
far O
more O
observations O
to O
yield O
an O
“ O
APT O
” O
. O

Yet O
irrespective O
of O
this O
, O
it O
is O
confusing O
why O
the O
previously-declared O
“ O
TEMP O
” O
category O
was O
walked O
back O
as O
this O
has O
led O
to O
not O
small O
amount O
of O
confusion O
– O
in O
both O
technical O
and O
non-technical O
audiences O
– O
as O
to O
just O
what O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
’s O
blog O
post O
refers O
. O

Thus O
respected O
journalists O
( O
at O
least O
by O
me O
) O
conflate O
the O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
actor O
is O
active O
at O
another O
site O
” O
with O
“ O
TRITON S-MAL
malware O
was O
identified O
at O
another O
site O
” O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
we O
’re O
seeing O
a O
definite O
problem O
with O
the O
overly-conservative O
naming O
approach O
used O
as O
it O
engenders O
confusion O
in O
a O
significant O
subset O
of O
the O
intended O
audience O
. O

While O
some O
may O
dismiss O
adversary O
or O
activity O
naming O
as O
so O
much O
marketing O
, O
having O
a O
distinct O
label O
for O
something O
allows O
for O
clearer O
communication O
and O
more O
accurate O
discussion O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
conflating O
adversaries O
with O
tools O
, O
since O
tools O
can O
be O
repurposed O
or O
used O
by O
other O
entities O
than O
those O
first O
observed O
deploying O
them O
, O
leads O
to O
further O
potential O
confusion O
as O
the O
“ O
X S-TOOL
actor O
” O
is O
quickly O
compressed O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
some O
to O
refer O
to O
any O
and O
all O
instantiations O
of O
tool O
“ O
X S-TOOL
” O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
discussion O
above O
may O
appear O
so O
much O
splitting O
of O
hairs O
or O
determining O
how O
many O
angels O
can O
dance O
on O
the O
head O
of O
a O
pin O
– O
yet O
given O
the O
communicative O
impacts O
behind O
different O
naming O
and O
labeling O
conventions O
, O
this O
exploration O
seems O
not O
merely O
useful O
but O
necessary O
. O

Understanding O
the O
“ O
how O
” O
and O
“ O
why O
” O
behind O
different O
entity O
classifications O
of O
similar O
( O
or O
even O
the O
same O
) O
activity O
allows O
us O
to O
move O
beyond O
the O
dismissive O
approach O
of O
“ O
everyone O
has O
their O
names O
for O
marketing O
purposes O
” O
to O
a O
more O
productive O
mindset O
that O
grasps O
the O
fundamental O
methodologies O
that O
( O
should O
) O
drive O
these O
decisions O
